there is a new version of the verdix ada compiler installed on vaxc  all
persons using this compiler please contact terry as soon as possible  also
if there is anyone using the nyu ada or telesoft ada compilers please let
terry know we would like to remove them from the system if they are not
being used we need the disk space thanks

the imagen is once again operational but with reduced capacity one of the
memory boards is being repaired  large documents may not work

sh about the course
spk
winstons textbook is excellent and has been widely acclaimed
i think that in the main it is quite understandable probably too easy
you should fistudy it carefullyfr not just read it casually
set aside some time each weekk
do some of the exercises
the main function of the lectures is to take you through the text
providing additional explanation where necessary
there will not be time however to cover everything in lectures
cp
this is not a course on programming and we will not be talking much about
programming in lectures
however by the end of the course all students are expected to have a working
knowledge of the lsisps language and assignments and projects are to be
done in lsisps
people welleducated in ai need to know the basics of
fibothfr psrologs and lsisps
each has strengths and weaknesses that it is important to understand and
can only be appreciated properly through experience
ppk
many students will have had some prior exposure to lsisps and all are
well versed in psrologs
you are expected to pick up lsisps programming by yourself
you do finotfr need to become expert in lsisps
there will be no exam questions involving tricky language details em
at most you might have to read some code or discuss pros and cons of ai
programming in lsisps vs psrologs vs psascals

this is not a course on programming and we will not be talking much about
programming in lectures
however by the end of the course all students are expected to have a working
knowledge of the c programing language and assignments and projects are to be
coded in ck
the text gives all examples in pascal for pedagogical reasons only part of the
assignment work involves demonstrating your understanding of algorithms by
recoding them
c is the principal modern graphics programming language in use today and
anyone welleducated in computer graphics need to know how to use it and to
interface with programs written in it
you are expected to pick up c programming by yourself the ta will be more than
happy to help you with language constructs and points of syntax
