is the following conjecture reasonable andor provable 

given a sequence of digits starting with a nonzero digit of arbitrary
but finite length is it always possible to extend this sequence by
appending more digits in such a way as to form a prime

eg the sequence  can be extended into a prime in an infinite number
of ways as in       etc there an infinite
number of primes beginning with a  by bertrands postulate
however it is far more difficult to try and locate a prime which
starts with the sequence  although at least one is known

my personal opinion is that the conjecture is reasonable simply because
one can keep adding digits at the end and checking for primality ad
infinitum and the law of averages will do the rest of course this is
totally groundless mathematically so can anyone provide a heuristic
argument with more weight

text editors cannot simulate structure editors  they can do a rather
feeble job of it  text editors fall down when context information is

i disagree  a programmable text editor can do anything you want  this is
because its programmable  whether youre happy with the performance or a

sure it can do anything the best way for a programmable text editor to
simulate a structure editor would be for it to build an internal 
representation or structure or what was really being edited and then 
use its text manipulating primitives to show the user the effect of his 
editing commands on the structure that is really being edited now youve
shown that mocklisp for example is a language in which you can implement
a structure editor i doubt if it is the best way to do it though

for example  a structure editor can supply different commands different
facilities for editing comments and code
seems like theres the potential here for moby modefulness  i cant see
why i would want different commands when i edit code compared with comments

i dont know about commands but common lisp comments are nothing
like common lisp code much to the shame of common lisp i want the
characters i type in as comments treated differently than those i type in 
as parts of sexpressions

my interest is in an pseudowysiwyg editor which gives you the option
of enteringediting text without formatting attributes then optionally 
displaying the text with them this sort of decoupling between editing a
document and a representation of a document could even be used to great
advantage in many environments

youre right an editor which is really editing the structure underlying
the visual presentation of it is a useful thing 

a program code editor might actually be showing you variable names
statements and sexpressions while it is really writing the pcode
or lbin file on the fly
this could result in instant language interpreter facilities and 
fast compilers
i admit that this might be hairy to program in mocklisp

but it is one of the reasons xerox structure editor fans are fans

disclaimer ive never used a structure editor 

no offense intended but i could tell if you write any lisp you should
look for an opportunity to try sedit on a dmachine

  well someone else was wondering who would be the actors in a tolkien
film which brought to mind a favorite question of mine from a few years
back who would play the parts of a amber film i used to have the

corwin mel gibson

jonathan pryce from something wicked this way comes

  even better how about timothy dalton james bond isnt the only thing he

brand whos the guy from kiss who was in runaway

  you mean gene simmons  well he could play the part but he has to look like

  no way brand is a figure both like bleys and myself my features though
smaller my eyes bleys hair there was a quality of both strength and weak
ness questing and abandonment about him this is corwin speaking of course

  and bleys is a fiery bearded flamecrowned man dressed all in red and
orange mainly of silk stuff and he held a sword in his right hand and a
glass of wine in his left and the devil himself danced behind his eyes as
blue as floras or erics his chin was slight but the beard covered it

  i cant think of anyone offhand for either part but i nominate gene simmons
to play caine then came the swarthy darkeyed countenance of caine dressed
all in satin that was black and green wearing a dark threecornered hat set
at a rakish angle a green plume of feathers trailing down the back yeah
i got nine princes in amber lying right next to the keyboard here

  random a wilylooking little man with a sharp nose and a laughing mouth
and a shock of strawcolored hair how about dudley moore with his hair
bleached of course

  dierdre a blackhaired girl with floras blue eyes and her hair hung
long and she was dressed all in black with a girdle of silver about her
waist lee meriwether or kate jackson

  fiona with hair like bleys or brand corwins eyes and a complexion
like mother of pearl  annmargret

  thats all for now if people are interested i can type in the whole 
pages of descriptions so well really have something to argue over

some introduction
however we have conflicting ideas concerning what to do with sender
addresses in headers  we do now support the idea that a pure path
coming in can be left as a path with the current hostname prepended
this is optional and is a function of the destination  however
should i ever produce in mail originated locally a from line in the
following form

from localhostusername

the answer is perhaps in an ideal world everyone will adhere to one
standard for mail headers  rfc possibly but x is more likely
until that glorious day arrives if it ever does mailers at the mail
gateways between networks will have little option but to munge
addresses because of incompatible mail headers and addressing formats

what you mail system should do is rewrite mail headers into the
appropriate form for transmission to a given host in short if your
uucp neighbours only understand bangstyle addresses you mailer should
only present bangstyle paths to these sites if some sites understand
rfc userhostdomain then you should send them rfc style mail
what would be less easy for the mailer is separating your bangstlye
uucp neighbours from those who understand rfc

the best mailers mmdf or sendmail  no flames please take an input
address convert it to a canonical form and then rewrite the address in
the appropriate style for the message transfer agent this is the most
sensible way of dealing with hybrid addresses like abc does that
mean send by uucp to a for relaying to user b on host c or does it mean
send to c for them to relay to user b on uucp host a then what if c
or a doesnt like addresses with  or  signs in them

anyone remember a movie called thequestortapes   basic premise govt
project constructs an android according to eccentric scientists specs and

cchiesa

  yea verily i recall the questor tapes ive forgotten the scientists
name but he was a very rich and secretive genius known for several major
advances in robotics and cybernetics about  years previous to the start
of the movie he had disappeared leaving only a partially completed project
he called questor much of the work was complete including a small fusion
reactor most of the brain and a lot of the support machinery he also left
a big mag tape of programs which some government idiot had partially erased
while trying to decode it questor when activated did nothing the team
that assembled him figured it was because of the bad tape

  late that night questor got up used the finishing molds to give himself
human features and walked out the scientist had known one member of the
questorassembly team and put his name and address on the program tape by
good fortune it had survived the attempted decoding questor knows only that
he must find a boat  other details have been erased

  the government catches up with them in a playground and some fool shoots
questor apparently the shock knocks some bits loose because when he sees
a jungle gym that looks like noahs ark he remembers the boat the boat
of legend whatsisname is waiting for me there he also remembers that
if he doesnt find the scientist within about two days his fusion power
supply is programmed to overload and blow up

  they patch him up and he leads them a merry chase to mt ararat where he
finds his creator in a cave hidden by a force barrierhologram projection
there is a long row of metallic slabs suspended about a meter above the
floor on each lies a defunct robot each one wears clothing from a time
far earlier than the next questors creator lies on the second to last
slab still conscious but unable to move

  these robots have been watching over the human race for more than ten
thousand years each one lasts two hundred years then builds his successor
questors predecessor was brought to an early end by some combination of
pollution and radiation exposure he has provided questor with extra
shielding so he will last the full two centuries

  questor is the last by the end of his term the human race will have
reached a point where we can make our own decisions without guidance
the robots were placed here by some advanced aliens to see us through our
racial childhood to allow us a chance to mature and achieve whatever
potential we have

  the questor tapes was an excellent movie one makers of more recent films
should take a lesson from very few other movies have impressed me as much
as  a space odyssey and the questor tapes they show up the likes
ofclose encounters of the third kind and et for the vapid silliness
they are

by far the best thing i have read by mjh is a long short story called
running down about a man with unwanted psychic powers that cause things
to malfunction decay and fall apart around him it is set in a britain
in the near future of when the story was written ie about now in which
the whole society reflects a similar dingy pointless chaos  remarkably
like britain after  years of thatcher in fact
hes very good at describing that sort of situation  his novel the centauri
device does it at length though his suggested political solution is bloody
stupid his understanding of anarchism is about on a level with robert anton

tippett moved on a long way musically after a child of our time
i believe his masterpiece is the triple concerto for violin viola and cello
there is a wonderful recording of it by pauk imai and kirschbaum with the lso
under davis
a problem i find with a lot of his music is the silly words the man really
shouldnt have tried writing his own libretti that often
i believe hes got another opera in the pipeline due for its premiere in the
next few months

last weekend a friend and i strolled into a music shop and ended up playing
with the new casio mg midi guitar linked into a roland mt i dont
play guitar and was just along for the curiosity but ive got a few comments
to make and a question about what i consider to be a midi bug in one of the
instruments
   firstly  the performance of the mg i wasnt actually playing it i was
just pushing buttons on the mt instead but i was impressed with its
speed and tracking ability  it was fast and followed pitch accurately
responding to pitch bend and so on it generally sounded pretty tight
there were a couple of things i didnt like  but maybe its a generic
weakness of all guitartomidi systems firstly the guitar transmits
velocity information hit the string harder  louderbrighter note but
gives no control other than pitchbend once a notes sounding  theres
nothing equivalent to aftertouchmodulation so once a note sounds youre
at the mercy of the synth until you stop the string
point two  youve got six strings so you can only sound six synth voices
this is probably obvious but playing a guitar patch through midi doesnt
sound like a real guitar because each touch of a string retriggers the voice
on that string sometimes in a rather distracting way on a real classical
guitar you have the resonance of the soundbox to hang on to notes so you
arent aware of this i presume  comments
now for what is in my opinion a midi bug play two different notes on
two strings and you get two voices  ok so far play the same note on two
different strings and you get one voice humm play two different notes on
two strings and slide one note up to the other and one of the voices is
chopped off i think this is a bug  something somewhere doesnt want to
the same note more than once needless to say this completely screws up
a number of guitar chords
   we mentioned this to the guy in the shop he seemed convinced that its
a problem with the midi spec itself  if you play a keyboard synth you
have to release the middle c key to play it again dont you i think this
is a load of dingos kidneys  if i send my d two separate middle c
note on messages then ill get two voices cycling through the envelopes at
middle c pitch this is what happens with the sustain pedal on as well
   whats the verdict net people i think the guy was wrong quite adamant
but wrong and theres a bug in one of the boxes i suspect the mg
if the mt is anything like the d then it doesnt care about playing
the same note twice a quick note in passing that synths with less voices
juno for instance often wont double a voice in an attempt to play
chords properly without running out

you might try looking to see if kresource is still available by kuma software
who else  its been out a long while  its now available bundled with some
of the metacomco stuff in particular the new lattice c but i believe that
kuma still do it separately as well  dont have a clue what it costs but
must be cheaper than a new compiler

it produces by switch option appropriate include type files for c
fortran and  other languages which ive conveniently forgotten  in
addition to the expected rsc file  will also produce a nonspecific
structured description file they say ive never tried this which is
alleged to be pretty easy to massage into an appropriate include for
any unsupported language you might like

the documentation is written in a bit of a toofolksy style for my liking
but the program is pretty intuitive to use which makes up for some of that
it does however assume that you have some sort of a clue as to what the
various resource itemsflags mean and do  it doesnt teach you how to use
rsc files or what they mean but rather gives a handle for making them

 what else has he written i believe hes not been very prolific

 what else has been recorded

 is his other work similar to the requiem it is better worse or

 i thought i heard a holst influence is this typical

 are there other th century composers in a similar vein that i

during the last several weeks there have been numerous solutions posted to
the net to resolved the interface problem with xenix and smail   i
have tried all the solutions that i am aware of and my conclusion for the
best approach is a combination of two

lots of stuff about how to install smail deleted

i have just installed smail  on xenix   the solution i used
here was to replace usrlibmailexecmail with a link to copy of
binsmail  i also moved the old sco execmail to execmailsco and used
it as the local delivery agent  the above will not work as it stands
because the command syntax for execmail is not the same as smail this
can be corrected by swapping the meaning of the f and f switches in
smail mainc and defsh   the local delivery macro in defsh should
be set to give usrlibmailexecmailcom f from to   with this
setup you get the sco mailer mailx and smail with both from and from
lines correct  also as execmail is still used for local delivery

 is is known how to perform leastsquares fitting where the error is
 the perpendicular distance between the point and the line

this leastsquares fit still passes through the center of gravity of the
data points so assume that the data has been reduced such that the
averages of the x and ycoordinates are both zero  let the equation of
the line to be determined be

    xsin phi  ycos phi  

that is it is the line making an angle phi with the xaxis  put

    xx  sumi xi
    xy  sumi xiyi
    yy  sumi yi

then tanphi  xyxxyy

this gives two solutions for phi  take the one such that the point
xxyy xy lies on the ray through the origin with angle phi
remark  it is possible to solve the coefficients for x and y
algebraically without going through the arctan routine but it is harder
then to get the signs correct

the question was asked why an arsa controller might want to know your
destination

actually what they really want to know is where youre going now like
direct pmd or following i northbound i have no idea of what type of
airspace that will take you through at any given altitude or whatever course
heading or whatever you intend to take through the arsa

now if youre going to get flight following the controller is going to want
to know your complete route of flight for which you want flight following
so that it can be entered into the machine and the autumated handoffs can be
used between sectors and facilities

as for why thats very simple  for purposes of calling traffic which i
consider to be sufficient if no one else does  the same reason the
controller at the vfr tower asks your direction of departure  if nothing
else the controller can always tell the left downwind departures traffic a
whatever reported  se for a left base entry or whatever is appropriate

my opinions only

 i have foggy but pleasant memories of three other converted japanese
  not anime but ultraman was it hiyata the beta capsule
 he was a large silver goodmonster with a red light
 mounted on his chest that would blink whenever his batteries
 were getting low  and in his valiant exhausting fights
 against the dinosaur types that frequently showed up to
 menace the world he almost always came close to running out
 and i remember a obligatory postcrisis trip to the jewelery
 store for hiyata and friend
 
 would anyone like to refresh my memory about any of these three
 
        ultraman was one of several incredibly popular shows in japan during
         the late searly searly s  actually there were several shows
         each featuring one or more of the ultra brothers of whom ultraman
         was the leaderheadeldest you get the idea  there was also
         ultra  and a bunch of others which i cant remember and it would 
         take a long time to dig out the books  there was something of a
         revival when ultraman   was released in japan  

         of these i believe that only the original ultraman was released
         and dubbed for the american market

        by the way hayata would be the way to spell his name though it
         would be more accurately pronounced by you gaijin as hiyata
         
        of course there is nary a trace of him now in japan  programs
         have this incredible tendency of grabbing hold of everyone then
         they drop it for something new

i have encountered a problem trying to make a shell script that would
make incremental backups at nighttime without operator attendance
the problem results from dump program requiring occasional
responses from the operator through devtty  the script is
run from another script usradmdaily under cron control and has no
controlling terminal so it just hangs trying to read devtty  it would
be ok if dump just aborted when facing a situation that would require
operator intervention the script should never hang in a loop under
any circumstances because usradmdaily must do other things too
and finish after a reasonable time

currently i have the dump script run a background subshell that sleeps for
an hour and then kills the dump script if it still runs and all dump
processes  this is very complicated however and the watchdog process
is almost  of the whole script  it is also very slow  i would
like it to stop immediately if it finds an error report it to log file
rewind the tape and let usradmdaily continue its work

has anyone out there in the netland have any suggestions of what to do
can yes somehow be piped to a program that reads devtty
could dump be modified to abort at errors without any questions
what kind of unattended backup systems do you have

 more seriously ive seen bottles of wine for cooking that have had
   salt and vinegar added  these might be ok for sauces yeah the
   snootier gourmets wouldnt want anything to do with them but they
   would obviously be horrible to drink

i think that these wines would be particularly bad for sauces that require
wine as a major component and require reducing the wine there are two
reasons that come to mind

 what is normally labeled as cooking wine is usually wine that is not good
enough to sell as table wine if the taste is not the best reducing it will
only concentrate its flaws

 cooking wines contain salt reducing a cooking wine will concentrate the
salt this could really ruin the sauce 

there best reason i have seen for using a good wine to cook with was given
by alexis bespaloff in the new signet book of wine which states

 furthermore it is actually uneconomical to buy cheap wine for cooking
  say that an elaborate lobster dish calls for a spoonful or two of sherry
  to heighten its flavor a cook who runs out to buy a bottle of cheap
  sherry will diminish the taste of an expensive and timeconsuming dish with
  a quarters worth of wine whats more because the wine is a poor example
  of its type it may not be enjoyable to drink so the spoonful of wine has
  in fact cost the full price of the bottle

that is fairly sound reasoning of course the last sentence does not
necessarily follow you could keep the cheap wine around to diminish several
meals

btw i recommend the new signet book of wine to anyone who wants to learn
more about wine it is available for  as a paperback quite a value
when you compare it to the ormore glossy coffeetable wine books out
on the market

 mr konar press the n key immediately theres another arrogant
   audiophile going to pollute the net with his view on the digital vs
   analog issue

 im not very much acquainted with the news stuff on the net but it
   seems we dont receive the recaudio newsgroup here in europe can
   something be done about that

 now let me come to the point
   in article batcomputertncornelledu eacjbatcomputertncornell
   julian vrieslander he writes
konar than goes on to comment about the arrogance of audiophiles who still
prefer analog recordings to digital  he says the issue should be laid to rest
 the implicit assumption being that the case has been proven that analog 
recording is obsolete

i for one think that the issue is still an open and interesting one but i
am a bit surprised at how polarized and closed the recent comments to this
thread have been  

i agree with him so let me do my bit now a technology not being perfect
 or getting close to that is still worth a discussion remember that it
took about a  years of thorough research from edisons first grammophone
to the modern high quality turntables dont expect digital audio to be
perfect now only a few years after its introduction no matter what the
commercial guys say they are only interested in your hardearned 

until now i have only been in the opportunity to make a good comparison
between a highend turntable and some first genaration ill summarize
the pros and cons of which i think are important and which i can think of
now many of them are well known others may not

pros of analog
 cheap records
 as john vrieslander mentioned more real more spatious more delicate
  more emotionally involving i wont try to find other words for this
  description cause i cant think of a better one unfortunately this
  can only be heard on good say  kk systems without an infinite
  number of knobs lights and other gadgets normally found in aeroplane
  cockpits

cons of analog
 more hissy rumblescratchessound degrading after many times of
  playing the record this counts less when you have good records
  japanese ones are most often excellent but hard to get now and take
  good care of them
 no flat frequency response especially at the low and high end
 phase distortion
 harmonic distortion increases with amplitude

pros of digital
 longer durability than records  less hissy no rumble or ticks of
  scratches
 almost no phase distortion flat frequency response within the audio
  range
 easy to use
 slightly  more dynamic why only slightly well the  db dynamic
  range theoretically possible with a cd is not very practical in reality
  it is compressed as far as i know to some  db depending on the
  music pop jazz classic because
  a no one wants to run continuously to his volume knob to adjust the
     volumeif not compressed the music will either be banging through your 
     living room and of your neighbours or it will drown in the inevitable 
     background noise
  b studio equipment has a dynamic range of less than say  to  db
     when you assume the signal to noise ratio being equal to the dynamic
     range
  c sound gets to distorted at low levels see also cons
  d a dynamic headroom of  db is desired
  with all this limitations the dynamic range of cds is not much different
  with that of a good record
 excellent bass response deep and well defined
 very stable stereo image

cons of digital
 expensive records
 when listening to a cd it seems as if there is no space around around
  the instruments and voices it sounds cold and not very lively
 first generation players and the cheaper cd players nowadays suffer from
  very distorted high tones they sound harsh cymbals for instance sound
  like someone is sawing them into pieces instead giving it a gentle hit
  with a drumstick they do not sound crisp and clear
 distortion increases dramatically with lower amplitudes  it can be
  more than   at low levels and its a very nasty kind of distortion
 cd players produce digital noise above the audio range this noise itself
  can not be heard but other audio equipment may suffer from intermodulation
  distortion which brings this noise back in the audio range 
 many cd players especially the first ones do not seem to be very reliable
  mechanically
 ive heard that digital audio recording is quite different from analog
  i mean in terms of how it has to be done properly i dont mean the
  equipment needed thats quite obvious not all studio crew seem to know
  how to make a good digital recording does anyone know more about that

well this must be enough stuff to think and talk about

the above mentioned cons of digital audio may be overcome in the latest
players but i have not had the opportunity until now to carefully listen
to them and to compare them according to some serious audio magazines
available here in holland they seem to be improved many topoftheline
models now have separated power supplys for the digital and analog
circuitry optocouplers between those circuits an additional analog filter
to filter out   khz noise  bit with with n times oversampling stable
and rigid chassis and improved error correction all this may have solved
some of the cons i mentioned but im not sure players which have one or
more of these improvements and thus may be of interest at least for julian
vrieslander and me are philips magnavox in the usa i believe cd  and
cd  nakamichi mission meridian and if memory serves me well acoustical
research or audio research dont know anymore the latter two may be
difficult to get in the usa they are made in the uk no doubt that there
are more good cd players but cant think of others now these are the
players i consider buying when normal lps are no longer available

pooh that was more than i intended to write but still far less than i can
tell about this stuff

using the  gnu emacs terminalemulator   to run interactive  programs  would be
quite limited if the parent emacs  cant be used  for editing when the program
run under the emulator starts up an editor  while some  programs  like rn
allow to explicitely specify the  editor a general  solution would require  to
specify emacsclient  in the editor   environment  variable of  the  process

naturally this could be done by running  the  shell under the emulator setting

should a band play the entire new album when they do a concert


no why should they there may be songs on the album that are 
very good listening to at home but just doesnt make it live
just as there are songs with the opposite character good live 
but just a bore on disc

deep purple and marillion and good example of extremes in both
ends when i saw dp in february this year they played three 
of the ten songs from the house of blue light their latest 
album that is a quite decent product but i didnt miss those
songs anyway i and everyone else would have been much more 
disappointed if they had left out smoke on the water 
  marillion on the other hand on the two tours they made after
misplaced childhood they insisted on playing entire album
as one long song there are many parts on that album that just
becomes dead passages where nothing happens when they are played
live bitter suite and blind curve for instance marillion
is no good live band and playing obsolete material does not
make things better

grady toss ebmernieberkeleyedu writes
whenever this newsgroup gets around to discussing ss fusion the
current goround sparked by the proof that yes is best the content
seems to be limited to the same  or  groups yes rush elp king
crimson pink floyd genesis etc  

grady seems to be confusing the issue a bit here he talks about fusion and 
the mentions groups that belonged to the symphonicrock genre i prefer
that term instead of progressive for me fusion is a synonym with 
jazzrock anyway that is more of question of semantics the two genres 
have a lot in common the main difference maybe being that symphonyrock 
is european and fusion american

the reason why these groups are being discussed the most is probably that
they have gained the greatest commercial succes this may or may not 
be correlated to the fact they are the best 

doesnt didnt anyone listen to
some of the apparently lesserknown fusion greats  bands and artists
like arti  mestieri brand x arthur brown  kingdom come egg gilgamesh
hatfield  the north henry cow alain markusfeld national health pfm
quiet sun return to forever seventh wave the soft machine uk and
weather report  

being quite fond of this kind of music i feel obliged to comment its
a real mixture grady presents and i must admit there are names i have 
never heard anyway i think he is a bit unfair some of them have 
certainly been discussed on the net for instance i posted a discograhpy 
on brand x some month ago some comments to the other names
  pfm premiata forneria marconi have been mentioned from time to time
the italian answer on genesis which developed in a different way now
disbanded i believe one day or another may be ill post a discography
  quiet sun the band in which phil manzanera played before he joined
roxy music their mainstream is rather like jazz but not mainstream
  seventh wave this is the name i never expected to see on the net i
bought their things to come when i was  and i was really fond of it
then these days i dont find that amount of synthesizers so exciting as
i did then
  wheather report quite wellknown but really you do only need heavy
wheather the one with birdland may be some more mysterious traveller
perhaps but then youll find that they all sound the same

as i said before i find much of yes and elp to be very dull and un
affecting  i like rush though more live than on record  

as you can guess i dont share gradys view here yes has made good
music yet never really touched my soul probably due to their utterly
stupid and semireligious lyrics brain salad surgery is a very good
record the rest of what elp have done is soso rush dont turn me on 
at all on the other hand the net discussion inspired me to try 
a farewell to kings a random choice may be i would have liked them 
 years ago but not today with those lyrics and that voice

so were yes elp pink floyd king crimson genesis and rush really it
as far as most progrock fans go or did some of these lesser known artists
and all the others i forgot or never knew filter out to larger audiences

depends on how you define your terms here but i can easily think 
of more groups some of them succesful some of them not some of them
good some them not so good
kansas saga asia jethro tull roxy music gentle giant van der graaf
generator george duke billy cobham al dimeola herbie hancock dixie
dregs ange mahavishnu john mclaughlin santana bill bruford etc
  i think that most of these people have had their share of the discussion
on the net so to conclude i do not really share gradys initial obser
vation however some particular groups are certainly being overdiscussed
namely rush yes and recently also pink floyd

background

atts generic unix v for the  as sold in binary form by att
bell technologies intel interactive systems microport prime etc
will run binaries created for unix v on the   a large number of
packages exists for atts  plus an based system running v
these can be run on based systems while youre waiting for
software authors to come up with native  ports of their products

problem

you are supposed to load packages onto your  plus using the systems
administration procedures  these handle weird multivolume cpio diskette
sets which are a pig to load unless you have the installation software
which you dont if youre trying to load the software onto an based
system running ix microport or whatever

solution

heres a shell script which does the job  if you want to know the details
it reads k starting at offset k from each k diskette in the
installation set piping the result into cpio c  it the fires off the
install program which should be part of the application package  as the
comments remark theres not a lot of error checking as its essentially
a quick hack  also testing is about at the worked twice in a row
level  despite all that i hope its useful to somebody out there

just to add to the confusion let me put in a plug in for the carnegiemellon
university computer science departments syntax
host

stolen from the newcastle connection

 is known as the superroot  it seems logically consistent to me

so what is the result of
 cd 
 pwd

 of course

if you add directories above root and remember that with the newcastle
connection  was just a directory rather than some mysterious 
superroot so that it is possible for your current directory to
be in an uncle or cousin relationship with root rather than a direct
descendent then you have to modify the pwd algorithm accordingly

pwd assumes that if you go up the tree with  enough times you will
get to root if your current directory is in a sideways relationship
to root this assumption will no longer be valid

the modified pwd algorithm should work like this

 go up the tree with  from your current directory until you
find  or reach the base of the tree a directory which is its own
parent

 if you didnt reach  in  then starting from  go up to
the base of the tree with  and prefix the appropriate number of
s to the string from 

for example after cd cd step  will give cd and step 
will give  so the answer is cd

this is relatively straightforward to implement ive made the necessary
modifications to the system v binpwd and sh which has a builtin pwd
for use with a kernel implementation of the newcastle connection

the tricky bit is getting the shortest possible pathname for example
if  corresponds to ab in the global naming tree then after
cd c the modified pwd algorithm would give ac which is
correct but redundant a is the same as  if  is ab

this can be fixed if you keep a record of everywhere you visit in  and
stop in  when you reach somewhere youve visited before but since in
an infinite naming tree this would require an infinite amount of storage
and isnt very efficient in any case it is easier to simply implement
the algorithm given which also requires an infinite amount of storage
in the general case of course and ignore this problem

also seeing him getting exponentially redshifted toward rm but
never getting there  i liked the presentation of this in my gr textbook

the observer if he waited around long enough would also
see the black hole evaporate by hawkins radiation

but from the point of view of the observer the poor fellow
can never cross the event horizon before the hole evaporates
away from under him

therefore the poor fellow must observe one of two things
either he crosses the event horizon in a finite amount of
time or he will observe the black hole to vanish as he
approaches

 sets up a paradox but  implies that anything falling
into a black hole cant get into the black hole before it
evaporates ie the black hole cant form in the first
place it just get very close to it


would someone please comment on the above i am sure i must
be missing something im no physicist

who we are and what we do

as a company we produce  custom  solutions  on  handheld  and portable
equipment  primarily   customising   hewlettpackard   handhelds  for
example we recently installed almost   hp handheld computers as
networked  terminals in  dhss offices as part of a document  tracking
system developed by us to a dhss specification

were not just a software  house but also develop custom  packaging and
electronics where necessary too  our customers are primarily government
departments  here and abroad but we have also  produced  products for
individual sale through dealers such as the zenwand barcode wand for
the hp which span off of the dhss contract

although our products are almost exclusively  related to handhelds our
expertise  stretches through to custom chip design and  mainframehosted
software  packages  mainly  under unix  as a  consequence  we regard
ourselves as a solutions  house rather than being specific to software
hardware design or whatever

we have one  office in  leeds  have been  around for seven  years and
employ over  people at present  is that a reasonable summary

satie yet his vexations for piano is meant to be repeated  times
it takes about  hours to perform he also wrote some pieces of music
to be played in particular spaces  music for a boardroom is one
that comes to mind  which go round and round in circles i think that one
would produce some  aggressive board meetings

our system manager has reported that there is a problem with using emulex cs
qbus comms cards which are not at the latest revision level under vms    
these cards appeared to work fine under vms  and earlier

the emulex cs card configured as two dhv line muxs gives phantom
devices when running show device   for example txc to txc become txc to
txc  there are problems in using the lines  for example controly acts
on the group of lines not just one  there are other problems known to emulex 

the solution is to upgrade the firmware prom on the card to at least
revision p  emulex may make a charge for this

ive been trying to set up a cshell  bsd alias for emacs gnu
 not that it matters which when run the first time will
actually run emacs but after suspending emacs with cz will bring
the background emacs job to the foreground  the catch is that id
also like the alias to reload emacs if i exit with cx cc  simply
stated i want an alias named emacs which will load emacs if it
isnt already loaded but will foreground a background emacs if one
exists

i know i could do this with a script if i assume the emacs job is
always job  but id prefer an alias since theyre faster  it
would be especially nice to determine which background job was the
emacs job and foreground it instead of just assuming job 

any ideas or alternate approaches  should i just put up with the
occasional fg no such job message

here is something which should do part of what you want it doesnt
accomplish to start a new emacs process if you exited the last one
with cx cc  unless the first one had never been suspended
whenever you get fg no such job just type i reinvoking the
commandline prefixed with an i iemacs standing for init emacs

alias emacs iemacs
alias iemacs alias emacs remacs emacs   alias emacs iemacs
alias remacs fg emacs

here we use a special version of suspendemacs that will look for a
file emacspause in the users home directory when emacs is
resumed in this file suspendemacs expects to find the current
working directory and an optional command line that is parsed like
the initial command line  very useful
this could be done using suspendresumehook but the hook wasnt
available in  when this was first implemented here

these are the aliases i use together with the special version of
suspendemacs

could anyone please shed light on a problem i have in compiling the s
statistical package from att on our sun system

system specifics sun  under sunos  using the m macro
processor supplied with the s system s version date fri feb  

using the hints on compiling with bsd systems i only get apparently
harmless warnings under the compilation this could for example be

warning on line  of hcpf local variable i never used
warning on line  of stemsf statement cannot be reached
f warning file with unknown suffix usrlocalsrcssnewfunlibgrz
     passed to ld
or
dprintc line  warning illegal combination of pointer and integer op 

furthermore there are problems with the utility routine scandatac which
fails with error too many local variables this is fixed by making the
declaration of table global not pretty but it works

these are all the kinds of problems that appear during the
compilation and it will result in an executable except
the fing system doesnt even know how to add two numbers as seen in
the following

onetime initialization for new s user in usrmciesdtapjpc 
directories swork and sdata created
   
bad operator

and more depressing errors
why does the prefix command work while the matrmatrixrnorm stuff dont

so have anybody made this run on a sun system and how did you do it
all suggestions or pointers to which direction i should go are welcome

i experimented with offscreen pixmaps today it seems that color
quickdraw is very flexible but too slow for good animation most of the
overhead comes from color matching and conversion i guess i could write
my own color matching routine but i think there should be a fast way to
do a simple copy operation

in most painting programs the actual painting could be done on an
offscreen bitmap with the same color table as the best gdevice

it takes about twice as much time to do a copybits in srccopy mode than
it takes in the srcxor mode below is a short program that draws to an
offscreen pixmap and then copies it back to the screen try different
transfer modes and note the speed difference the code is written in ls
c  even srcxor which is the fastest usable mode is too slow for
really high quality animation

how can it be done faster

if not could you please email me the latest version

the problem is when i run binddrivers that task stops binddrivers
never exits it seems to fallover on a particular call to execbase
the last instruction displayed by metascope is  mov aa

heres a suggestion for an improvement at least i think it is  to the
pickup option in nethack which someone who is familiar with the source
code might like to implement 

make the pickup option a composite option like packorder and rewrite
the picking up code so that the types of objects specified will be
automatically picked up all other objects could still be picked up by 

eg pickup  would pick up scrolls spellbooks wands rings
                                   potions and weapons

this would be useful for those of us who dont like carrying hoards of
gold around and also to prevent picking up dead cockatrices while still
picking up other objects

btw does anyone know what the options null and news do

in article brladmarpa dsillnswcoasarpa dave sill writes
i used to be rather fond of c but this error stuff is quite
incredibly bad  the problem isnt really the language its
the libraries

rather than messing with errno i think a new variable say liberr
should be used  an include file say liberrh could contain macro
definitions for the various types of errors  a macro named liberr
could also be defined in liberrh so code could be written that would
take advantage of liberr if it was available or handle errors in the
usual way if its not  even better would be to have liberr be a
predefined macro like ansi unix vax et cetera


this still has the same problem as with errno namely that youre trying
to describe a general error condition using a single number im told
that vms but its a good idea for all that provides a stack of error 
values which allows a program to search backward to find out what the real 
error was depending on what kind of detail is required if you have several
levels of library calls between you and the system call that failed this
can be extremely useful its not really much use having an errorvalue
if you cant even tell what system call it came from let alone what parameters
were passed to that system call to cause it to fail

a decent errorreturning mechanism would describe

 what call syscall or library call failed
   this could be a number you could use something like internet
   addressing to put some kind of structure into it
libcstdiofopen
 why it failed
   simple enumbers will do for this although i suppose theyd
   have to be grouped for different libraries
estdioecannotopenfile
 what value it returned
file null
 what parameters were passed to it
   this is the most difficult one because it would have to have
   some kind of idea as to the types involved it could i suppose
   deal only with string types and convert any other type into
   printable form by doing the equivalent of sprintfing it
   it also has to be a list which means it would probably have
   to be done using something like argcargv
argc 
argv mumblesplat r

if the error is not dealt with then this information should propogate
down together with the info from the callees failure and so on

so if you do a
fopenmumblesplatr
and it fails then the following would be left on the stack in some format
or other to be dealt with by some errordiagnosing function

kernelopen
param  mumblesplat string
param   int
returns  int
error ekernelenoent
libcstdiofopen
param  mumblesplat string
param  r string
returns  file 
error elibcestdioecannotopenfile

the errordiagnosing stuff could then print something useful such as
stdio fopen couldnt open file mumblesplat for reading because
    kernel open no file or directory mumblesplat

and of course the format of these messages could be userconfigurable so
that noddies would just get the information they need whereas people who
understand what theyre doing could get reams and reams of info just by setting
some environment parameter to the appropriate value

of course all this stuff would have to be known by the compiler and im sure
itd be dead slow to execute

then darn it it is well within my imagination
if it can be done within  lifetimes
i can still grasp how difficult it should be  a real difficult thing would
be something that takes say  lifetimes

in short i find the above ad quite naive  nsa guys should probably
have something better than this for the inspring encryption student
what do you say

 is is known how to perform leastsquares fitting where the error is
 the perpendicular distance between the point and the line
 
 if the point is xiyi and the line is y  ax  b then the square of the
 perpendicular distance is yi  axi  b  a assuming the line
 isnt vertical taking the sum of the squared distances and setting the
 partial derivatives wrt a and b equal to zero you get the same equations 
 for a and b as you get from the usual leastsquares procedure

see the book pattern classification and scene analysis by ro duda  pe
hart chapter  section  introduces the usual least square fitting
minimumsquarederror line fitting and  the one asked by dale
eigenvector line fitting there the problem is solved

in article ogcvaxuucp schaeferogcvaxuucp barton e schaefer writes
 i realize this might be similar to another question asked recently but 
 
 another student here at ogc recently came to me with a question about the
 c autoincrement operator  the following program is representative of the
 code he wrote which did not do what he expected
 
     struct foo  struct foo tmp char junk  foolist
 
     main 
     
 struct foo bar
 
 bar  foolist
  do something with bar 
 bartmp  bar this is the problem line 
  do something else 
     
 

this is really dangerous programming the points where the left and where the
right bar are evaluated are implementation defined the problem is similar to
another one which a friend of mine had some time ago he tried to pack as much
as possible into the control part of a while loop using the following statement

while aibi
  

things were even worse here as the program behaved even differently depending
on whether it was compiled with the optimization option or not non optimized
everything worked as expected but in the optimized version only for the first
assignment i was incremented after the assignment for all the following
assignments it was incremented after the evaluation of bi but before the 
assignment nevertheless this behaviour was in the sense of both kr and ansi
the only thing you can trust on is that the operand of the increment
operator is evaluated before its incrementation one way to achieve the desired
behaviour is as you suggested yourself to write

 what he really wanted was the equivalent of
 bartmp  bar
 bar

and not for the same reasons stated above

 bartmp  bar

if there is any necessity to have the whole semantic in one expression use
the comma operator as

bartmp  bar bar

this operator guarantees the sequential evaluation of its operands from
left to right

for people interested here are a couple of bugs in the alcyon
compiler that weve been hitting our heads against for the last few
weeks

 the compiler doesnt seem able to cope with nested
   initialisations for instance a struct with an array in
   the middle
static struct foo table  
   


   the compiler complains about mismatched braces
   cure unwrap the struct declaration so its all at the
 same level

 in a construct like
bar p  expression expression
   the result of expression gets coerced to int and then
   back to bar  meaning basically that you get bombs on the
   screen when you try to use p due to a wrong address
   cure use
bar p  expression bar  expression

 we believe that complicated initialisations to auto
   variables in functions for instance where the
   initialisation involves a call to another function often
   come out wrong however by this point we despaired and
   stopped using the compiler so we never followed up on it

i might point out that were trying to compile a big program 
lines of c so just trying to trace bug  took us a lot of time

by the way just for interest to compile the lot from scratch using
a ram disk for temporaries would take  hours when we reinitialised
the disk partition and copied the files back a recompile only took
 hours

i have written a program to recursively compare the contents of two given
directories file for file  the program descends the tree and reports about
files that are missing or different  some day if i ever get around to
producing v of minix i will make a tree of the current version next to
the v tree and then run this program to get a list of all files that
are different  then i can make diff listings etc  in reality the reason
i wrote it however is that i had just copied my minix tree from one part
of the disk to another and i wanted to make sure nothing was forgotten
i am sure there are other uses as well    one could no doubt write a shell
script to do this same thing or perhaps use find but this program is
much faster being able to compare two  megabyte trees in about 
minutes on a z

please post any bugs you find

 treecmp  compare two treesauthor andy tanenbaum 

 this program recursively compares two trees and reports on differences
  it can be used for example when a project consists of a large number
  of files and directories  when a new release ie a new tree has been
  prepared the old and new tree can be compared to give a list of what has
  changed  the algorithm used is that the first tree is recursively
  descended and for each file or directory found the corresponding one in
  the other tree checked  the two arguments are not completely symmetric
  because the first tree is descended not the second one but reversing
  the arguments will still detect all the differences only they will be
  printed in a different order  the program needs lots of stack space
  because routines with local arrays are called recursively the call is
     treecmp v dir dir
  the v flag verbose prints the directory names as they are processed

does anyone know about the existence of a filter for the

 this laserprinter also has an hp laserjet plus emulation
another solution would then be to use a troff output filter

actually svid setpgrp has an extra feature that berkeley setpgrpgetpid

well you can do that by making each such pipeline belong to its own sxt
device and have all these sxts multiplexed onto your real terminal

btw svr and  setpgrp doesnt fully detach a process from its 
controlling tty if this process has already done a setpgrp previously
as is the case for a loginshell  this comes from init and getty
what it does in this case is to partially detach  so that if you try 
to set up a new controlling terminal its not actually a controlling terminal 
at all  things like terminalgenerated signals dont get sent to the process
presumably this is just a cretinous bug and not something more sophisticated

 the simple fact is that there is

 listen then we would
 
 
oh no not again remember last time when the number of articles complaining
about st articles outnumbered the articles concerned and every other single
type of article as well

there is a st group but not for all of us some of us cant get at it but
your point about headers is valid in the interests of preventing flame war iii
i suggest that those of us who wish to put st and dr who etc articles here
make sure that st or dr who etc or some similar warning appears in the
header and those who wish to complain about such postings should also always
put some clear warning in the header so those of us who arent interested can
kill their articles easily

a long time ago i read about a program developed at mit that produced
images of the way ordinary scenes a street would look at speeds nearing
c i dont know if it used a plotter or calligraphic display but it was
so long ago that whatever it did should surely be possible now in real time
on a mac or equivalent does anything like that exist  a sort of flight
simulator for cosmic ray particles that would let you define a scene
with a d graphics editor and then look at it at various fractions of c
colour would be a nice optional extra the mit program produced weirdly

this is only partly true

kuk is short for kaiserlich und koeniglich thats right
but it has nothing to do with the king of prussia

at the time kuk was used the king of austria was also the
king of hungary and the emperor of oestreichungarn austria and
hungary when thinking of kuk i have the picture of
kaiser franz josef a fatherly man who kept his nation in a long
period of prosperous sp peace especially good for the arts

btw otto von bismarck is remembered as a man who united germany
with an iron hand thats true which at that time was divided
into many small parts all of them having a duke different legislation
and borders between them this meant having to pay customs very often
thus disallowing free trade which in turn was necessary for the
upcoming industrial revolution so you might regard ovb a good statesman

 that has it please sent it to me in a reply msg please do not send it via

 thanx in advance
 barry

foldrxxx starts up with a little table of rom versions and corresponding
to each version an address at that address it inserts a list of memory
pieces to be used if you use new roms these addresses have been changed
so you cannot use foldrxxx unless you figure out the new address you need
and substitute the necessary information into the binary of foldrxxx  or
a disassembly  on the other hand the new version of the roms for the
mega has a much larger ospool from which these memory blocks are taken
it used to be  bytes but the new size is  bytes i dont know
whether this makes foldrxxx superfluous maybe allan pratt can comment
on that

 actually the correct interval of convergence is x  indeed in the 
 partial sum corresponding to knk the coefficients n are
 within a factor of  of k and the sum of xan is easily seen to
 be xk so by comparison with the geometric series sumrkkinf
 with rx we find that the series converges if and only if r
 ie x

this is correct but the way the proof is written is not easy to understand i
give below another proof

for n let

and for k let

zk  sum nk to k tn

we have

zk sum nk to k tn
 sum nk to k tn  tn  tn
 sum nk to k un

let us compare un to tn we have anan and ananan
thus

un  xann  xann  xann

and so un has as upper bound

xan  xn  tn  x

and as lower bound

xan  xn  tn  xn

in other words un  tn  xen where enn tends to
 when n tends to infinity it follows then that

zk zkxfk

where fkk tends to  for n tending to infinity

now the series is the sum of all zk thus for x we have zkzk for k
large enough and the series diverges for x we have zk r  zk with
rx for every k and the series converges for x the series
diverges too i think so because zkzk tends to  for k tending to
infinity

we recently acquired some western digital ethercard plus cards for ibm pcs
we were planning to write minix drivers for them and we wanted the hardware
documentation from the supplier we were indeed promised that
however as one might expect we only got the documentation that stated
where to plug in the cable and we are more interested in which ioports there
are and what they do our supplier is not very helpful at the moment

we will continue to nag our supplier but in the meantime does anyone have
the hardware info on this board
we know there is a natsemi dp on there and we have the datasheet on that
one but there should also be an ethernet address rom plus some other things
on the board

you should arrange that this pty is the control terminal of the

this is a bit of a flame which i hope does not upset some people
too much i have tried sending the comments privately but have had
no reply
i got a kinetics internal ethernet interface for a mac se plus the
ethernet driver test software and ncsa telnet version 
in order to try out this software in a safe manner i created a mini
ethernet with the mac and an ethernet monitor am i glad that i did
this
the test software when run tends to throw out a large number of
broadcast packets in a very short space of time sometimes one can
control the frequency other times not at least one test threw out
about  broadcast packets in much less than one second if i had
been on the real cern ethernet then a few hundred users would have
had to deal with these
flame on
when will people writing test software avoid the intensive use of
broadcast packets multicast would be slightly better but even then
the software should establish the address of those other computers
with which it can run a test and then address them directly
flame off for a while
i then tried to run ncsa telnet this also started out with about
 immediate broadcasts these started out with a set of three
types of broadcast
   arp with source ip address  looking for 
   something with type field f what the hell is this
   some other arptype type field b with sender as 
these three are repeated about  times at intervals of about
 milliseconds yes milliseconds there are then a few more type
b broadcasts at reasonable a few hundred milliseconds intervals
before telnet starts to arp for the real host that i asked for
flame on
why does software often insist on repeating packets at very short
intervals on vey reliable lans and have you seen the sun lately
flame off
despite all the above i waited for a quiet moment before connecting
onto the real ethernet i then tried telnet to our ultrix vax
immediate remark keyboard in application mode does not work for us
i then thought to run the vt test program which some of you might
also have picked up off usenet what a disaster the emulation fails
all over the place
never mind let us see if i can connect to our ibm vm system of course
i have to go via a spartacus knet because there is no ncsa tn
is anyone working on this complete failure spartacus has a bit of
a peculiar telnet setup though ultrix bsd and ftp inc telnet on
a pc work fine which seems to screw ncsa telnet
final try go through an ibm  frontend which has  to vt
built in sort of works using esc n for pf key n but since the
application keypad mode fails there is no way that i could get pa
for clear screen merde which the french will understand
flame on
i know that ncsa is now at version  why did i get version 
from kinetics and why must only a kinetics agent modify their mac scsi
box for a european power supply how do i get an updated version
quickly no i cannot do anonymous ftp why have these simple tests
never been reported before etc etc
flame off
i would be delighted if someone could tell me that all the above problems
are fixed in the current release

 i was asked this question by a guy on the weekend and was unable to help
 him  any of you hypercard gurus able to answer
 
 i want to have a background button which has a script that tries to find
 an arbitrary text  however when i try it it only finds the text in
 background fields not foreground  the find works properly when you use
 the message box how come
 
 jeff laing where for art thou compsysmachypercard
 
same problem here i noticed that strange find bug too my
solution is a real kludge but it works

instead of issuing the find command in script type the find command
with all the arguments into the message box and then again
from script add a return like

on mouseup
   type find  quote  key  quote  in background field id  number 
   return
end mouseup

this also makes the repeated find easier

i made a stack that needed a search option on partial keys so i wanted
hc to keep on looking when the user stated that the item found wasnt
the right one

i made a script to do this if interested i can mailpost it that
expects a second field for every field to be looked in the item found
is put in the second field named something like showname when
the user says he wants to keep on searching the next item found is
compared to the contents of showname if its the same my script
says that its all there is and cancels the search otherwise
a repeated search would be impossible

if you like i can upload the lot to compsysmachypercard maybe

to apple
why do you reply to all the easy answers in compsysmachypercard
bu happily skip all the possibly difficult ones seems like
the hypercard group chooses the easy way out too many bugs in hc
perhaps

consider the following variant of maxwells daemon

you have the following two items
     a metal block
     a bowl with a liquid
both items have the same temperature and are placed close together they
may however be thermally isolated from one another

now into the bowl you drop a very small magnet the motion of the
molecules in the liquid will cause the magnet to move slightly this
will induce a very small current in the metal block this current will
cause the temperature of the metal block to rise the current will also
try to stop the movements of the magnet this will in turn slow down the
motion of the molecules and the liquid will cool

the result the metal block will grow warmer and warmer and the liquid
will grow colder and colder

this contradicts the second law of thermodynamics and has the advantage
over maxwells daemon that no intelligence is involved

what is wrong with the above argument

bjorn lisper lisperyalecelrayuucp writes
bo hansson to be correct gee i didnt know that he was known outside
sweden this guy was a keyboard player who was active mainly in the late
sixties and early seventies he is remembered for having made the very
first record for the first swedish independent nonprofit label silence
unexpectedly the record became a hit and the income helped financing a lot
of records with early swedish progrock that would otherwise not have been
economically possible to make thus his importance for swedish rock music
cannot be overestimated

so he is the one being guilty to it all grr you see in sweden 
progressive music had nothing to do with the music when we speak 
or spoke at that time  of progressive groups we talked of groups
that played quite regular rock or pop there were just one difference
to the ordinary hit music the lyrics they were naive trivial and 
uttermost boring political texts of a communistic nature which does
not imply that they were paid by kgb or something i must admit i 
didnt listen to much to them their proganda was too much for me

now this kind of people dominated this nonprofit companies that bjorn
talked of for them ideological purity was much more important than
interesting than good music not to be denied some good music was 
actually released on silence and mnw the other big nonprofit but 
also a lot of true crap and i can easily imagine that groups with
interesting music was refused beacuse they voted with the wrong party
they would never have released yes that are right wing if anything

finally i should admit that despite the poorness of silence they
had the most interesting music in sweden at that time but that more
gives an indication of bad the rest was abba do you remember

 hi all well my mega just landed on my desk really nice ive got a question for all other mega owners using the hard disks i have been using gemboot with
 my st all along when i boot up the mega two bombs appear then disappear
 after gemboot has done its thing

do not use gemboot  use foldrxxx from atari  hinstall should be available
too it makes your hard disk bootable no boot floppy needed

the lastest version of gemboot which was distributed something like
half a year ago allows you to set the location of the sole undocumented
variable that konrad uses in gemboot matter of fact i used gemboot
without problems on one of the first megas that arrived in switzerland
after changing the gemboot startup file 

patches the appropriate location in the os  in the case of the mega
roms he actually added a pointer in the os header which points to
the necessary spot so foldrxxx will work for all future rom releases
                                               
didnt atari claim it was working on a new  folder bugless os                               

even old tos rom users should probably not use gemboot i certainly
wouldnt trust it and with foldrxxx and hinstall available you just
dont need it
hmmmm as landon dyer once said a long time ago foldrxxx does not fix
the other problem with gemdos management of the internal directory
list mutiple bad copies of the same block gemboot does provide
a workaround  for this problem so i wouldnt trust foldrxxx plus
a lot of other nice things

have to do a final thesisproject sometime  i might be
tempted to try a hand at an ml interpretercompiler  i would
like to hear from anyone who is tryinghas tried similar
projects

ml gives you objects with modifiable state so that you dont need to
pass a state structure around with you the disadvantage of course is
that you smash the applicative behaviour of the language 
whether its worth it depends what youre trying to do
   another way around this is to use type abstraction that way your
state structure is an abstract object with a few access functions to get
at the bits you need ive always used the former approach so i dont know
how far the latter approach gets you its quite possible to take non
applicative features like assignment and abstract over them to build
structured objects with varying state a la smalltalk perhaps this isnt
dirty functional programming  its just using a functional language as if
it were a language of a different kind i recently dedicated a lecture to the
structured use of sideeffects in ml
   by the way i have various little typecheckers and interpreters for tiny
functional languages lying around online somewhere if youre interested
all written in ml of course

what minimalist music is performable by a recorder consort terry rileys
in c is the one and only thing ive found so far almost no published
minimal music is available in the uk  i have drawn a virtually complete
blank at every major library and music shop in scotland

i guess this resolves into two questions does it exist and if it does
can i get it do glass et al have the same attitude to scores that att
does to source code

 ok  perhaps you had better tell us neophytes what you mean by the
 address of an array

same as address of anything else  it is an address which when
indirected yields an array and when n is added to it yields the
address of an array which is itself a member of an array n elements
away from the array yielded by an indirection
 
  several abstruse observations 

what could be simpler

well several other forms of explanation i guess  this one confused me
and i understand the address of an array just teasing

to put it another way

any object of any type integer structure array etc has an address
usually if it is an object that occupies several words of memory it is the
address at which it begins compiler theorists may be itching to tell me it
might mean something else entirely lets keep this simple  the address of
an object is the compilers handle for manipulating it   you think of an
object by its name the compiler thinks of it by its address

the address of an array is the address that the compiler uses to access
that array and to calculate the position of any element in the array

in c  the address of an array is the same as the address of its first
element array  if you want to set up a pointer to the array you
get its address simply by naming it hence

pa  array pa now contains the address of array 

which is exactly the same as

pa  array   means address of so pa contains the
address of element  of array 

now this is a slight quirk in c  the name of the array being a synonym for
its address  for any other object notably a struct that is not true  if
you want the address of a structure you must write

ps  mystruct not ps  mystruct 

so we get back to the discussion from whence we came why cant we be
consistent and get the address of an array by

pa  array

to which the answer is  you can with some compilers

i think i found a bug in basicplus of rsts v the following program
isnt working in the right way i tried to read some records from a file
and to store them in an array but after i read and stored all records
the array was completely empty

  on error goto 
  dim in
  field   as a  as i  as q
  open foobar as file  recordsize 
  z  
  z  z  
  get  record z
  inz  i
  print inz
  goto 
  close 
  print ini  for i   to z  
  goto 
  if err   then resume 
  on error goto 
  end

the outputs in line  are alright but those in line  arent
only blank lines appear there

i found out that if you change line  to inz  lefti 
 which does nearly nothing different  it works correctly

does anybody know a patch for this bug or does anybody know how to
avoid this in an other way

thanks in advance

in article culdevuucp drwculdevuucp dale worley writes
the normal leastsquares fitting of a line to a set of points in the
plane assumes that the xcoordinates of the points are known to be
exact and the ycoordinates have all the error  that is chi is
the sum of the squares of the distances from the points to the line in
a vertical direction  this introduces assymetry between the
coordinates

is is known how to perform leastsquares fitting where the error is
the perpendicular distance between the point and the line


actually if both coordinates have error it is essential that this
fact be taken into account if you fail to do this the result will be
biased  the slope will be systematically underestimated and
this bias will not go to zero as you take more and more points

hold on isnt this statement a bit too strong the answer to which method
should be used ultimately depends on what the purpose of the estimations
is 

in fact if the purpose is to estimate y for a given x then ordinary
least squares will do in this case one is not really interested in
getting the best estimates of the parameters but only in getting a good
prediction

i claim that there are very few regression examples where one really
cares whether or not the parameters are biased in the large majority of
cases one is much more interested in the goodness of prediction in this
case one is interested in eyx so if we model this quantity as
linear in x then the ols estimates are blue this will also give
variances etc all valid conditionally on x

it is my feeling that a lot of books overemphasize the socalled bias
since that is very often totally irrelevant  for example some
textbooks talk about biased parameter estimates when some variables
are missing in a multiple regression in reality ols is estimating a
better set of parameters than would the corresponding unbiased
estimator ols in this case will give an unbiased estimate of the best
surface based on the reduced set of variables certainly in this case
one can make a strong argument that all the talk about biasses is
totally irrelevant

of course if the true purpose is to estimate parameters eg to assess
the effect of a change in x on y then indeed one needs to worry a bit
about the effects of x being random

consider a path embedded into the cartesian plane where for convenience
all vertices of the path are lattice points in the positive quadrant
all edges are line segments
so the path will look like  xy  xy    xnyn   
question    what is the fastest method of determining all self
     intersections of this path
this may have been beaten to death by computational geometers so ill
append some extra conditions
suppose there are many vertices in the path and that edges are
for the most part very short    for example there could be 
points in a  by  square with most edges less than  units long
furthermore assume that there are not very many selfintersections
to be found    now what would the fastest method be   any ideas
welcome

there are as youve guessed several papers in computational geometry
on line segment intersections  you may look at the books by shamos
and preparata and also the book by edelsbrunner for references

my favorite method to solve your problem though is an excellent
method invented by randolph franklin at rpi  it is called adaptive
grid and works as follows  first you overlay a regular say g by g
integer grid on your scene  then you enter your edges into respective
cells of the grid  similar to the bucketing idea  then you make a pass
thru all the cells and find the intersections in each cell  if an
intersection falls on a grid cell boundary you should be careful to
treat it so the integrity is kept intact

im not very good in describing things in a hurry especially email
but let me tell that ive wide experience with this stuff and it works
very well  it is especially excellent for a scene made of short edges
with a rather homogeneous distribution  write me for details
also you may try franklin at franklincsvrpiedu  here is a short bibl

               in real time  comp graphics and image proc

 discussing primos wildcards versus unix wildcards
for example how would you do the equivelent of this in unix

explanation compare all files in the old subdirectory ending in c or
h with the file of the same name in the current directory and put
the output in the file of the same name with cmpf appended  nonfiles
directories and segment directories ending in c or h are ignored
i do prefer the output of diff c to that of cmpf but that isnt
what im talking about here

uhm yes unfortunately i find the feature quite unusable
i never come up with the correct sequence of  and  so i have to type
the command three times before i get it right really retype that is
history mechanism is something primos has never heard about

i definitely prefer
for i in ch do
    diff oldi i idiff
done

and you can add an if  d i  if you really care about directories
ending in c or h i dont because i dont have directories ending
in c or h

and to continue some gripes on primos wildcards
 i would expect them to work always ie if i do
  type 
  type is primos echo i would expect a list of all files not 
 if i want all arguments on one line and i use wild tmp and the
  result doesnt fit in  characters i do definitely not want it to truncate
  it at eighty chars i lost an important file that way it was trying
  to generate a list containing preciousfiletmp but unfortunately
  the tmp started at position  so it removed preciousfile in stead
  sigh
  
sorry there are some neat ideas in primos but the command processor and
its wildcards is definitely not one of them

it can handle but an at it should be over  per second

i have a program written in msc parts coded with masm which does
quite nice things with grapichs but suffers lack of characters
according to my knowledge the only way to get characters in herc graphic
mode is to draw them on screen by lightning a set of pixels right
 
somebody must have written a program which draws characters and
other symbols so please help me  c andor asm sources andor ideas
will be very appreciated

 i tried sending this as mail using different addresses but failed 

in article steinmetzsteinmetzuucp you write


i have tried using fcntlfdfsetflfasync as well as setting up an
interrupt handler to handle sigio signals via sigvec and this works
fine when im reading from the terminal but does not seem to work at all
when i try it from a pipe


well the sigio handler works fine to detect input from places like stdin but
never sees anything coming down the pipe  when it gets invoked generally
by me banging on the return key causing an interrupt from stdin it 
does find that there is data available in the pipe as well as stdin and
has no problem reading it


does anyone out there know how i can fix this problem


from looking at the bsd sources i found out the following
when a tty is opened the associated process group is set to
that of the creator the signals that the tty driver generate eg caused
by c are sent to this process group

however for sockets a pipe is implemented as a pair of sockets in bsd
and maybe elsewhere the associated process group is not set automatically

so what you have to do is to set it before you can get ant sigios use
   int pgrp  getpid
   if fcntlfd fsetown pgrp   
perrorfnctl
exit
   
or
       ioctlfd siocspgrp pgrp note  

i think this should work even if pipes arent implemented as a pair of
sockets but i havent tried any of it

also  is there a way that i can determine which file descriptor caused
a sigio interrupt to be invoked or by which i can set up a different
interrupt handler for each descriptor


see select just a detail select will tell you that there is data
to read if there actually is data to read or if the other ends have
closed the pipe in the latter case read will return an eof  this
stuff caused me some trouble before i read the real documentation 
the os source code

hello ive been wondering how to get a little extra memory for my
macintosh plus needed in these days of hypercard and multifinder

i was wondering if the normal bruteforce method could be used
  just solder m memory chips on top of the existing one piggyback
  and attach cs chipselect and whatever else is needed from the
  adressbus to select the appropiate chip i havent really checked
  out the memorychips but maybe an inverter is needed for some signals

  if im correctly informed there are  bit defining the adress on
  a mc making it possible to have m of memory

if this is possibly would programs take advantage of it

well maybe this is one of the most stupid questions asked to usenet
since it all began and if so  please forgive my ignorance

i have only the faintest interest in the st stuff and i would prefer it

i think the interesting question is why do we have different newsgroups

i always thought it was to organize postings by subject and because different

ncsa telnet is really a must but 
on a mac se and a mac ii ncsa telnet  forces an american keyboard in a
permanent manner it remains after exiting telnet until the next macintosh
reboot it is very painful when you use for instance a french keyboard
not only you have to remember to type q for a and so on but you cannot
type for example a controlz under telnet
on a macintosh  one do not loss its keyboard

is this bug fixed in the last version

i havent compiled the new micro emacs since i have a msc compiler which is
not fully supported

this is simply not true i am also working with msc version  and had only
one minor problem when i compiled microemacs e the latest version which
was posted on usenet this problem relates to the subshell spawning but if
you know just a little bit of c there is no problem to fix it add a routine
specific to msc some time ago there was even a posting in compsourcesbugs
describing all the necessary steps to do that

i have been having a very annoying problem with the
older version and am wondering if it has been fixed or if someone has a
work around i am used to saving my files regularly with xs and then
sometimes quiting with xc unfortunately uemacs will quit before
completing the writing of the file leaving me with only a small piece of
the file 

i am sure you enable breaking with c either in configsys or in autoexecbat
turn this off and all your problems have gone 
i know this is not the solution to this problem we all want to have perhaps
you can do it with signal if not you have to included a function of your own
which intercepts the break vector of msdos

  i maintain that the noninterlisp systems are wrong however  it
is clearly more advanced to treat a file as a database of definitions of
functions data structures etc than to treat it as a string of characters
that might have been typed at the keyboard  however since the rest of the
world hasnt caught up yet there are bound to be incompatibilities

character file storage is simply more flexible  the form in which
information is stored must be the most flexible possible or you lose
information  the dcrates pitching of conditionals is simply the
manifestation of this

proponents of restrictive protocols for information storage really ask
the world to change to fit the protocol model  in science models
change to fit the data not the other way round unless you cheat
to me browbeating eventual nonconformists into catching up by
labeling the a model as advanced is just a form of negative
motivation  all the lousy places i have ever worked ran on negative
motivation none of the good ones  if your model is really worth
using and you can communicate its value you will not need such
tactics 

interactively defined functions  havent typed one in years 
thats what scratch buffers are for in case i want to change a
character or two or later save it

any mousebased gadgets you can point to in interlisp can be recreated
for a text editor working on correctly parsed lisp code  may  take
execution time but if this is prohibitive your function is probably
too large

     those interested in the issues surrounding the mechanics and
philosophy of fantasy worlds should read tolkiens nonfiction
essay on fairystories  it appears in the collections tree and
leaf and the tolkien reader

     one of the main ideas behind it is that the fantasy author or
storyteller is a subcreator who tries to create a secondary
belief rather than exactly a willing suspension of disbelief
in the reader  in the fantasy that works the reader should be
able to enter the world every time she picks up the book and not
be aware of the world as being constructed by the author  this
involves not only internal consistency but a lack of gimmickry

     for instance in lord of the rings i was never aware of
anything being in the world gratuitously  others may differ 
in the sword of shanana sicsick on the other hand i was
very aware of the elfstones as being just a gimmick to get the
characters out of tight spots  sure it was internally consistent
the elfstones only had any effect in times of direst need for
their holders but the hand of the author was clearly visible

     similarly applying it to frpgs the magic system in add is
certainly internally consistent to the extent that it is described
but just doesnt work for me  having mus able to remember several
copies of a spell but forgetting it when the last copy is cast is
obviously a gimmick to limit the number of spells an mu can use

     so i guess the moral of all this for frpg or module designers
is that its best to start out with a few basic assumptions and build
up your world from them by fairly believable steps and if you cant
avoid ending up with something really hairy then change one of your
assumptions rather than put in quick kludges  gee sounds like
software engineering

  does anyone preferably in the uk or europe have a copy of the new
x toolkit interface definition i can get by ftp

  im considering implementing the x toolkit in standard ml  are there any
constraints on what i should include or exclude  the documentation mentions
implementation in different languages but doesnt say much about what this
means  is the idea to provide the same functions with the same names and
functionality in each language  what about languages that have automatic
storage management or automatic creation of objects etc  how far can i
deviate from the documentation  still use the name x toolkit

  is the toolkit definition limited to the intrinsics or are toolkits
expected to provide a standard class hierarchy

  is there any relation between the interviews toolkit the xr sx 
dec toolkits provided with x version r and the current x toolkit

  if i go ahead my first implementation will be a prototype on top of x
version r  this is because someone else is working on porting x version 
to standard ml and i want a simple windowing system i can use fairly quickly
i hope the prototype will make implementing a full version reasonably
straightforward  i will probably ignore the resource manager since ill get
that for free when the full xlib is implemented  ill also ignore colour for
the time being and only implement devices widgets im immediately interested
in  is there anything else i can obviously ignore

some possibly timely information from a course entitled the art of
communication for engineers that im on this week

from one of the handouts 

word processors research has shown that when writers use pen and paper
 alone their thoughts and information tend to have better planning and
 organisation when using word processors alone writers tend to plan
 on a more surface level focussing on such aspects as word choice sentence
 structure and spelling

it goes on to recommend starting with pen and paper and graduating to wps
after the first draft has been written

i trust that this may have been of some interest

reach and so i thought id kill two birds with one stone and post
another article
  his argument is very simple using the prime number theorem to give
an approximation to the number of primes between xn and
xnn which is the same problem i asked but translated to
mathematics which shows that as n  inf this number of primes also
goes to infinity a very simple argument that proves you can always
append digits to make any number into a prime great stuff

this should perhaps belong in comparch

it would appear that most  and  systems are
limited by the number of cycles taken to execute instructions
ie the clock speed  however the  at  and esp at  mhz

on most  boxes is fast enough have little or no real effect on
performance compared to a change in clock speed   an

 bit memory subsystems have a devestating effect on the

one thus doubling the access time  secondly most  bit memory cards
are designed for  or  mhz operation not  mhz so a significant
number of wait states are needed when used with a    it would
appear that a cache miss on the intel inboardtm generates beteween

just want the instruction set use the p   if it ever appears

turned out to be quite a problem when a desk accessory i had downloded

was not to boot from hard disk at all which i now find better since it
allows me to choose different configurations desk accesories and such
depending on the job im going to do

i am also using gemboot to overcome the  folder limit in toshas it been

im also interested on this question and it has been already asked a couple

mathematical analyses at least in vol i are also appreciated
im especially interested in classical mechanics  philosophical
implications of physics laws such as causality etc are also interesting

send me individual replies and ill post a summary to the net thanks

ive been told that there is a bug in the game such that you must get to
the pedestal asap else the blue key wont be there this is what has happended
to me

the story ive heard is that this is not a bug  rather as warned in the
manual the other characters you meet are also poking around and can have
effects even while they are not in the same location as you

in particular as ive heard it if the adventurer gets to the pedestal before
you do then he will take the key  and allegedly you then can recover it when
you kill him  i havent tried this line of play yet so cant vouch for it
but it sounds plausible

theres a cute bug in the st version though to do with the pedestal  if
you move the pedestal and then type take all you end up carrying the pedestal
a duplicate of which remains in place  if you just try to take pedestal
you are told that it is too heavy to lift  im told that this results from
a bug in the relevant object definition table entry so it might have propagated
to other versions  id doubt that the driving data undergoes as much analysis
as the executable code during porting to other machines

hi
   i have a problem with the zorland c compiler aka datalightc or
northwestc which i wondered if any netlander had previously encountered
and solved
   i have a program which works fine in small model but recently i had
to go to the data model small code large data whereupon it hung my
xt clone tracing execution seems to indicate that the dos software
interrupt routine int may be the source of the trouble
   has anyone seen problems with int in d or l model programs the
prospect of debugging the interface between c and assembler does not
appeal to me
   btw i have deliberately not given details of the program i do not
       want to debug it on the net please email me only if you have
       solid evidence of problems in the int area

      thanks for any help you can give

i want to start wargaming but i dont know how

i wont be playing wargames on a board but with mm or mm
figurines
i would like to find addresses in europe especially belgium
of good figurine manufacturers and also references to rule
books for the napoleonic period

the best set which ive found are the wargames research group   
rules although the time period sounds a bit long these rules have the
following advantages my opinions only

 wide ranges of troops covered you can fight outside europe
 wide range of weapons covered pikes for those moscow militiamen etc
 simple solution for combat  this is what i really like theres
      no nonsense evaluating every th of a casualty or evaluating
      grenadier companies firing separate from the rest of their battallion
 all weapons are handled simply just a different entry in one table
 movement is alternate not simultaneous things move much quicker
 hand to hand combat is decided very quickly just like reality
 morale tests are also quite fast to do and give specific tests for
  different situations this avoids an old problem where eg horsemen test
      morale before charging test fails horribly horsemen rout off the 
      field to make you go away the opponent actually has to do
      something
 european regulars have national characteristics
    ie british are disciplined infantry and rash cavalry
       russians are stoical infantry wont retreat easily
       spanish are easily panicked
       highlanders charge aggressively
       french columns are impetuous and frighten the enemy
       austrian and prussian cavalry are bold
       austrian spanish and dutch generals are cautious

together with these rules i would recommend the army lists published by
table top games

these cover the european armies for most of the big campaigns of
 and ensure a balanced army is selected although the 
 point armies dont always work too well
eg my russians need  gun artillery batteries  pieces on the table
   this leaves me few points for infantry or cavalry
   in practice a russian  point army has two of inf cav  art

the lists also help to enhance the national flavour of an army
ie british get few cavalry but some veteran infantry
   french after  have raw infantry or guards
   austrians have very large numbers of infantry

i can summarise some of the  points of each of the armies ive seen
if you mail me

id recommend mm scale troops much cheaper and more transportable
    theyll fit on your table too

i actually use the mm scale which is cheaper lighter and requires
about cm x  cm for a medium game
however the job of painting mounting and moving the little guys is
much harder


i am also interested in rules contained on the net or in files at
other sites if they exist

copyright makes this difficult

i anybody can help me please reply to mcvaxprlbllncsgf

 i have recently been told be someone that the hitchhikers guide to the
 galaxy originated as a radio program rather than as a book

the radio series the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy was broadcast in 
britain for the first time between  sorry for the range but all i

it was   episode  of the first series was a pilot production for the
whole thing and as such is slightly different in flavour to the others  the 
first series  episodes covered the ground of the tv version and books 
and   then came the christmas  show to make a link to the second
series which was broadcast in  and consisted of  episodes

 for my money the show and scripts are much funnier than the books

true  the radio shows left much more to the imagination with the assistance
of some very good sound effects  i thought the tv series spoiled it  for 
instance at the end of the first radio series you hear the song what a
wonderful world amid the sound of burning trees on prehistoric earth cant
you just imagine it

although x as distributed uses tcpip to connect clients and server it
is possible use other network protocols by relatively small changes to
the lowest levels of library and server  we have almost gotten the
server half of such a setup running using amoeba a distributed
operating system with its own capabilitybased rpc mechanism
the library half should be working as soon as we solve problems with the
c compiler

the question is how much does this buy us  since amoeba is not unix x
clients requiring advanced unix features wont run under vanilla amoeba
what percentage of the available client applications will be convertable
to a different operating system where eg one will have stdioh
available but not select  i would assume that there will be vms
support for x so that one might expect clients to be osindependent
but then again you can never know what hacks a performancedriven
application programmer may use including vax assembly 

can anybody comment on this  it would also be interesting to know if
thirdparty software for x would come binary or source

the five books are quite different in character the second one

on the other hand number  the making of the representative of planet 
was rather depressing while reading it i thought that it cant get any
worse than this it could of course i dont refer to the quality of the
book but to the events in the story

i should mention the title of the first one also shikasta this is

some tncs have problems with the waded software version 
most of the outgoing frames cannot be docoded by other stations because
the software turns off the transmitter before all bits have been transmitted

there are two solutions to this problem

hardware connect a small uf capacitor from the base of the ptt keying
          transistor to ground note you may have to increase txdelay

software the code that turns off the transmitter starts at location b
          e  its possible to insert a short delay loop so that the
          transmitter remains keyed for a few milliseconds longer
          i havent tried this yet

i am sending this letter out to the network to ask for solutions to a
particular problem of bayesian inference below is the text of the
problem and at the end is the mathematical statement of the information
given simply i am asking the questions

 can you find bounds on the final result if so how
 if not why is it not possible to do so 
   what is missing in the specification of the problem
 if you get nowhere with this problem would you be able to solve it
   if you were given the information ppvt or l

i am interested in the problem of providing probability bounds for events
specified in a bayesian setting when not all the necessary conditional 
probabilities are provided in setting up the problem 

problem

a problem relevant to the handling of uncertainty in expert systems
we want to know the probability of a patient having both lung cancer and
tuberculosis based on the fact that this person has had a positive reading
in a chest xray we are given the following pieces of information

 the probability that a person with lung cancer will have a positive
   chest xray is 

 the probability that a person with tuberculosis will have a positive
   chest xray is 

 the probability that a person with neither lung cancer nor tuberculosis
   will have a positive chest xray is 

 in the town of interest  percent of the population have lung cancer
   and three percent have tuberculosis

events

l  lung cancer       t  tuberculosis           pv  positive chest xray

setup

in the statement of the problem below

l means not l
l t means not l and not t
t or l means t or l
where not and  and or are logical operators
so that pl t means probability not l and not t
also
ppvl means the conditional probability of event pv given event l
priors

conditionals

ppvl           ppvt               ppv tl  

you are not given ppv t or l 

please mail all solutions or comments to me and i will let interested parties 
know what the results are 
i will specially treasure attempts which dont use independence assumptions
thanks in advance to anyone who will spend time on this problem

in fact the british must have
 been the most warlike nation in the world fighting with more countries than
 anyone i can think off is this the reason why the english language is so
 popular  hello america  

i assume you refer to the british empire  prior to that britain and before
the rest joinedwere conquered by it england fought mostly against either
france spain or both at once the wide domain of the english language is
directly due to the empire just as the wide use of spanish throughout south
and central america is due to the spanish empire

    i think also that all countries train their armies in ice and snow

including the arabs 

    as for the submarinewell i dont know about that i thought that was an
 english invention too like the tank and the jetplane maybe im wrong

there are a number of ancient submarine designs including one which was a
rowing boat with a watertight cover the first practical submarine was i
believe designed by a mr holland resident of ireland for use against the
royal navy the royal navy took over the design but regarded such concealed
warfare as ungentlemanly and didnt make much use of them until germany
showed the way

the jet plane was invented practically at the same time by britain germany
and the usa germany had the first flying jet aircraft followed closely by
britain britain would have had a jet fighter not long after the battle of
britain except for government intervention fortunately hitler was equally
stupid the nazis believed they would win the war in a couple of months and
gave little interest to projects which would bear no short term military
results when they did get the worlds first jet fighter the me it was
pretty devastating albeit rare until hitler decided that it would make a
great fighterbomber two bombs were fitted under the nose at the expense
of two cannon and much speed and agility fortunately nazi policy was if

i expected somebody to respond by now to the
question about a sf opera being cowritten
by philip glass and somebody named lessing

any other news on this opera

its the making of the representative from planet  if i remember right
this is from the announcements to a radio  broadcast of glasss new orchestral
piece the light  a tone poem about the michelsonmorley experiments

incidentally its not the first sf opera i heard a broadcast in new zealand
of a swedish opera called aniara based on an epic poem about a colonizer
spaceship on its way to oblivion i can remember neither the poets nor the
composers name

ive only read the first of lessings series and didnt like it much i felt i
was being preached at lessing is a sufi  i dont know whether her having
been born in iran has anything to with that  and it shows in her more recent
writing ok the content of the sermon may not have been as obnoxious as
heinlein tolkien or pournelle but it was still gratuitous in literary terms

a whole bunch of questions


does anybody run multiple subnets on a single ethernet

    if so do you use subnet broadcasts or net broadcasts
    do you find it worthwhile to use ethernet multicast for
    subnet broadcasts how do you assign the multicast addresses
    for what purposes do you still use net broadcast

    should redirects be provided by an intersubnet gateway
    when both subnets are on the same ethernet


what are the semantics of icmp redirect to net in a subnettted environment


does anybody run multiple classes of subnet on a single net

    does the mechanism proposed in rfc  icmp broadcasts to
    discover the subnet mask  still work do you use it

well the history repeats once again a new risc chip is launched and peopels
expectations reaches new high scores a few years ago there was another risc
chip set brougth to the market called the clipper this processors performence
was climed to sweep all competitors off the sceene often compared to the
dec x computers for this chip set the picture has cleared now the perfor
mence range is not much more than can be achived with a  mhz  the
most i have seen of the mhz versions is one running at room temprature
intergraph is one of the companys who is still using the clipper they recently
bought the rights for the chip set from nsfairchild  from what i recall they
throw out the ns for the clipper well they could have had  times the
clipper performance with the ns today and they called the buy a bargin 
its not suprising that the mips  gives most powermhz the architecture has
evolved during many years without a hard pressure from the marketing such as
we must have it now john mashey mayby has another opinion only my guess

well maybe that ive overlooked something really important but i dont
see the mb limit with the amigados
about a yaer ago when there was no mount command somebody from cats
posted a sample device driver that mounted itself it set up a device
structure which described the layout of the device this structure is
now documented in dosfilehandlerh one field in this structure holds
the number of longwords per block of this device this is always set
to  giving  bytes per block
now if i set this to   bytes per block i should be able to
increase the disk limit to mb
apparently amigados supports larger blocksizes just have a look into
the amigados manual from bantam all blocklayouts are described relative
to a size nowhere is said that size is fixed to  

so where is the problem  please send no flames only facts

ive not been very successful in getting goswells xps to preview documents
the postscript file generated from tex dvi files by dvips and from ditroff

if partition  is set up for dos and  for minix with  mounted under

one thing to remember is that the partition size for partition  is one
smaller than for partition 

another possibility is that the minix fdisk and the dos fdisk dont agree
on the meaning of the partition table  if everyone would create their
partitions from lowest cylinder to highest there would be no ambiguity
however if the order in the partition table is different from the cylinder
order there are at least three interpretations
   table slot  is partition 
   innermost cylinder is partition 
   outermost cylinder is partition 
i believe that the combination of minix dos xenix and microport together
exhaust the entire list of possibilities  i donknow if this is related
to your problem which i otherwise cant understand but it is worth

do you think that the women in the future working with men will be
trying to dress sexy  if so what about the men  why not let them
show off their body too to make things even   i think that the
producers or whoever is in charge of outfits and character development 
is making a contemporary decision regarding the issue of how people 
will dress in the future  ie heshe thinks that female will be 
trying to attract males attention by bringing out her femininity 
but not vice versa which is the current social behavior
or perhaps the producers are just being comformists with bunch of 
other tv shows  movie producers by keeping females attractive

did anyone think that the terralian ship was pretty big for something that
was built by a group of people whose technology approximated late th
century earth

it was my understanding from the show that the people of th century
earth could build a virus that could wipe out a planet  this did not
mean that they the terralians where of the th century tech level

there was more to the th century reference than that however
dr crusher made the point that since they were only at the technology
level of th century earth it was easy for the disease to get out of
control and spread over the planet  the implication was that if they
were more advanced the disease would not have wiped out the entire world
