orlandoas i remember adam it was upon this fashion
bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns
and as thou sayest charged my brother on his
blessing to breed me well and there begins my
sadness my brother jaques he keeps at school and
report speaks goldenly of his profit for my part
he keeps me rustically at home or to speak more
properly stays me here at home unkept for call you
that keeping for a gentleman of my birth that
differs not from the stalling of an ox his horses
are bred better for besides that they are fair
with their feeding they are taught their manage
and to that end riders dearly hired but i his
brother gain nothing under him but growth for the
which his animals on his dunghills are as much
bound to him as i besides this nothing that he so
plentifully gives me the something that nature gave
me his countenance seems to take from me he lets
me feed with his hinds bars me the place of a
brother and as much as in him lies mines my
gentility with my education this is it adam that
grieves me and the spirit of my father which i
think is within me begins to mutiny against this
servitude i will no longer endure it though yet i
know no wise remedy how to avoid it

charlesgood morrow to your worship

olivergood monsieur charles whats the new news at the
new court

charlestheres no news at the court sir but the old news
that is the old duke is banished by his younger
brother the new duke and three or four loving lords
have put themselves into voluntary exile with him
whose lands and revenues enrich the new duke
therefore he gives them good leave to wander

olivercan you tell if rosalind the dukes daughter be
banished with her father

charleso no for the dukes daughter her cousin so loves
her being ever from their cradles bred together
that she would have followed her exile or have died
to stay behind her she is at the court and no
less beloved of her uncle than his own daughter and
never two ladies loved as they do

oliverwhere will the old duke live

charlesthey say he is already in the forest of arden and
a many merry men with him and there they live like
the old robin hood of england they say many young
gentlemen flock to him every day and fleet the time
carelessly as they did in the golden world

oliverwhat you wrestle tomorrow before the new duke

charlesmarry do i sir and i came to acquaint you with a
matter i am given sir secretly to understand
that your younger brother orlando hath a disposition
to come in disguised against me to try a fall
tomorrow sir i wrestle for my credit and he that
escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him
well your brother is but young and tender and
for your love i would be loath to foil him as i
must for my own honour if he come in therefore
out of my love to you i came hither to acquaint you
withal that either you might stay him from his
intendment or brook such disgrace well as he shall
run into in that it is a thing of his own search
and altogether against my will

olivercharles i thank thee for thy love to me which
thou shalt find i will most kindly requite i had
myself notice of my brothers purpose herein and
have by underhand means laboured to dissuade him from
it but he is resolute ill tell thee charles
it is the stubbornest young fellow of france full
of ambition an envious emulator of every mans
good parts a secret and villanous contriver against
me his natural brother therefore use thy
discretion i had as lief thou didst break his neck
as his finger and thou wert best look tot for if
thou dost him any slight disgrace or if he do not
mightily grace himself on thee he will practise
against thee by poison entrap thee by some
treacherous device and never leave thee till he
hath taen thy life by some indirect means or other
for i assure thee and almost with tears i speak
it there is not one so young and so villanous this
day living i speak but brotherly of him but
should i anatomize him to thee as he is i must
blush and weep and thou must look pale and wonder

charlesi am heartily glad i came hither to you if he come
tomorrow ill give him his payment if ever he go
alone again ill never wrestle for prize more and
so god keep your worship

oliverfarewell good charles

exit charles

now will i stir this gamester i hope i shall see
an end of him for my soul yet i know not why
hates nothing more than he yet hes gentle never
schooled and yet learned full of noble device of
all sorts enchantingly beloved and indeed so much
in the heart of the world and especially of my own
people who best know him that i am altogether
misprised but it shall not be so long this
wrestler shall clear all nothing remains but that
i kindle the boy thither which now ill go about

enter celia and rosalind

celiai pray thee rosalind sweet my coz be merry

rosalinddear celia i show more mirth than i am mistress of
and would you yet i were merrier unless you could
teach me to forget a banished father you must not
learn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasure

celiaherein i see thou lovest me not with the full weight
that i love thee if my uncle thy banished father
had banished thy uncle the duke my father so thou
hadst been still with me i could have taught my
love to take thy father for mine so wouldst thou
if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously
tempered as mine is to thee

rosalindwell i will forget the condition of my estate to
rejoice in yours

celiayou know my father hath no child but i nor none is
like to have and truly when he dies thou shalt
be his heir for what he hath taken away from thy
father perforce i will render thee again in
affection by mine honour i will and when i break
that oath let me turn monster therefore my
sweet rose my dear rose be merry

rosalindfrom henceforth i will coz and devise sports let
me see what think you of falling in love

celiamarry i prithee do to make sport withal but
love no man in good earnest nor no further in sport
neither than with safety of a pure blush thou mayst
in honour come off again

rosalindwhat shall be our sport then

celialet us sit and mock the good housewife fortune from
her wheel that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally

rosalindi would we could do so for her benefits are
mightily misplaced and the bountiful blind woman
doth most mistake in her gifts to women

celiatis true for those that she makes fair she scarce
makes honest and those that she makes honest she
makes very illfavouredly

rosalindnay now thou goest from fortunes office to
natures fortune reigns in gifts of the world
not in the lineaments of nature

enter touchstone

celiano when nature hath made a fair creature may she
not by fortune fall into the fire though nature
hath given us wit to flout at fortune hath not
fortune sent in this fool to cut off the argument

rosalindindeed there is fortune too hard for nature when
fortune makes natures natural the cutteroff of
natures wit

celiaperadventure this is not fortunes work neither but
natures who perceiveth our natural wits too dull
to reason of such goddesses and hath sent this
natural for our whetstone for always the dulness of
the fool is the whetstone of the wits how now
wit whither wander you

touchstonemistress you must come away to your father

celiawere you made the messenger

touchstoneno by mine honour but i was bid to come for you

rosalindwhere learned you that oath fool

touchstoneof a certain knight that swore by his honour they
were good pancakes and swore by his honour the
mustard was naught now ill stand to it the
pancakes were naught and the mustard was good and
yet was not the knight forsworn

celiahow prove you that in the great heap of your
knowledge

rosalinday marry now unmuzzle your wisdom

touchstonestand you both forth now stroke your chins and
swear by your beards that i am a knave

celiaby our beards if we had them thou art

touchstoneby my knavery if i had it then i were but if you
swear by that that is not you are not forsworn no
more was this knight swearing by his honour for he
never had any or if he had he had sworn it away
before ever he saw those pancakes or that mustard

celiaprithee who ist that thou meanest

touchstoneone that old frederick your father loves

celiamy fathers love is enough to honour him enough
speak no more of him youll be whipped for taxation
one of these days

touchstonethe more pity that fools may not speak wisely what
wise men do foolishly

celiaby my troth thou sayest true for since the little
wit that fools have was silenced the little foolery
that wise men have makes a great show here comes

and all the world was of my fathers mind
had i before known this young man his son

le beaugood sir i do in friendship counsel you
to leave this place albeit you have deserved
high commendation true applause and love
yet such is now the dukes condition
that he misconstrues all that you have done
the duke is humorous what he is indeed
more suits you to conceive than i to speak of

orlandoi thank you sir and pray you tell me this
which of the two was daughter of the duke
that here was at the wrestling

le beauneither his daughter if we judge by manners
but yet indeed the lesser is his daughter
the other is daughter to the banishd duke
and here detaind by her usurping uncle
to keep his daughter company whose loves
are dearer than the natural bond of sisters
but i can tell you that of late this duke
hath taen displeasure gainst his gentle niece
grounded upon no other argument
but that the people praise her for her virtues
and pity her for her good fathers sake
and on my life his malice gainst the lady
will suddenly break forth sir fare you well
hereafter in a better world than this
i shall desire more love and knowledge of you

did i offend your highness

duke frederickthus do all traitors
if their purgation did consist in words
they are as innocent as grace itself
let it suffice thee that i trust thee not

rosalindyet your mistrust cannot make me a traitor
tell me whereon the likelihood depends

duke frederickthou art thy fathers daughter theres enough

rosalindso was i when your highness took his dukedom
so was i when your highness banishd him
treason is not inherited my lord

to think my poverty is treacherous

celiadear sovereign hear me speak

duke frederickay celia we stayd her for your sake

duke frederickshe is too subtle for thee and her smoothness
her very silence and her patience
speak to the people and they pity her
thou art a fool she robs thee of thy name
and thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuous
when she is gone then open not thy lips
firm and irrevocable is my doom

leave me alone to woo him lets away
and get our jewels and our wealth together

to hide us from pursuit that will be made
after my flight now go we in content
to liberty and not to banishment

like foresters

duke seniornow my comates and brothers in exile
hath not old custom made this life more sweet
than that of painted pomp are not these woods
more free from peril than the envious court
here feel we but the penalty of adam
the seasons difference as the icy fang
and churlish chiding of the winters wind
which when it bites and blows upon my body
even till i shrink with cold i smile and say
this is no flattery these are counsellors
that feelingly persuade me what i am
sweet are the uses of adversity
which like the toad ugly and venomous
wears yet a precious jewel in his head
and this our life exempt from public haunt
finds tongues in trees books in the running brooks
sermons in stones and good in every thing
i would not change it

amienshappy is your grace
that can translate the stubbornness of fortune
into so quiet and so sweet a style

duke seniorcome shall we go and kill us venison
and yet it irks me the poor dappled fools
being native burghers of this desert city
should in their own confines with forked heads
have their round haunches gored

first lordindeed my lord
the melancholy jaques grieves at that
and in that kind swears you do more usurp
than doth your brother that hath banishd you
today my lord of amiens and myself
did steal behind him as he lay along
under an oak whose antique root peeps out
upon the brook that brawls along this wood
to the which place a poor sequesterd stag
that from the hunters aim had taen a hurt
did come to languish and indeed my lord
the wretched animal heaved forth such groans
that their discharge did stretch his leathern coat
almost to bursting and the big round tears
coursed one another down his innocent nose
in piteous chase and thus the hairy fool
much marked of the melancholy jaques
stood on the extremest verge of the swift brook
augmenting it with tears

duke seniorbut what said jaques
did he not moralize this spectacle

first lordo yes into a thousand similes
first for his weeping into the needless stream
poor deer quoth he thou makest a testament
as worldlings do giving thy sum of more
to that which had too much then being there alone
left and abandond of his velvet friends
tis right quoth he thus misery doth part
the flux of company anon a careless herd
full of the pasture jumps along by him
and never stays to greet him ay quoth jaques
sweep on you fat and greasy citizens
tis just the fashion wherefore do you look
upon that poor and broken bankrupt there
thus most invectively he pierceth through
the body of the country city court
yea and of this our life swearing that we
are mere usurpers tyrants and whats worse
to fright the animals and to kill them up
in their assignd and native dwellingplace

duke seniorand did you leave him in this contemplation

second lordwe did my lord weeping and commenting
upon the sobbing deer

duke seniorshow me the place
i love to cope him in these sullen fits

the ladies her attendants of her chamber

they found the bed untreasured of their mistress

your grace was wont to laugh is also missing
hisperia the princess gentlewoman
confesses that she secretly oerheard
your daughter and her cousin much commend
the parts and graces of the wrestler
that did but lately foil the sinewy charles
and she believes wherever they are gone

adamwhat my young master o my gentle master
o my sweet master o you memory
of old sir rowland why what make you here
why are you virtuous why do people love you
and wherefore are you gentle strong and valiant
why would you be so fond to overcome
the bonny priser of the humorous duke
your praise is come too swiftly home before you
know you not master to some kind of men
their graces serve them but as enemies
no more do yours your virtues gentle master
are sanctified and holy traitors to you
o what a world is this when what is comely
envenoms him that bears it

orlandowhy whats the matter

adamo unhappy youth
come not within these doors within this roof
the enemy of all your graces lives
your brotherno no brother yet the son
yet not the son i will not call him son
of him i was about to call his father
hath heard your praises and this night he means
to burn the lodging where you use to lie
and you within it if he fail of that
he will have other means to cut you off
i overheard him and his practises
this is no place this house is but a butchery
abhor it fear it do not enter it

orlandowhy whither adam wouldst thou have me go

adamno matter whither so you come not here

orlandowhat wouldst thou have me go and beg my food
or with a base and boisterous sword enforce
a thievish living on the common road
this i must do or know not what to do
yet this i will not do do how i can
i rather will subject me to the malice
of a diverted blood and bloody brother

adambut do not so i have five hundred crowns
the thrifty hire i saved under your father
which i did store to be my fosternurse
when service should in my old limbs lie lame
and unregarded age in corners thrown
take that and he that doth the ravens feed
yea providently caters for the sparrow
be comfort to my age here is the gold
and all this i give you let me be your servant
though i look old yet i am strong and lusty
for in my youth i never did apply
hot and rebellious liquors in my blood
nor did not with unbashful forehead woo
the means of weakness and debility
therefore my age is as a lusty winter
frosty but kindly let me go with you
ill do the service of a younger man
in all your business and necessities

orlandoo good old man how well in thee appears
the constant service of the antique world
when service sweat for duty not for meed
thou art not for the fashion of these times
where none will sweat but for promotion
and having that do choke their service up
even with the having it is not so with thee
but poor old man thou prunest a rotten tree
that cannot so much as a blossom yield
in lieu of all thy pains and husbandry
but come thy ways well go along together
and ere we have thy youthful wages spent
well light upon some settled low content

adammaster go on and i will follow thee
to the last gasp with truth and loyalty
from seventeen years till now almost fourscore
here lived i but now live here no more
at seventeen years many their fortunes seek
but at fourscore it is too late a week
yet fortune cannot recompense me better
than to die well and not my masters debtor

a table set out enter duke senior amiens and
lords like outlaws

duke seniori think he be transformd into a beast
for i can no where find him like a man

first lordmy lord he is but even now gone hence
here was he merry hearing of a song

duke seniorif he compact of jars grow musical
we shall have shortly discord in the spheres
go seek him tell him i would speak with him

enter jaques

first lordhe saves my labour by his own approach

duke seniorwhy how now monsieur what a life is this
that your poor friends must woo your company
what you look merrily

jaquesa fool a fool i met a fool i the forest
a motley fool a miserable world
as i do live by food i met a fool
who laid him down and baskd him in the sun
and raild on lady fortune in good terms
in good set terms and yet a motley fool
good morrow fool quoth i no sir quoth he
call me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune
and then he drew a dial from his poke
and looking on it with lacklustre eye
says very wisely it is ten oclock
thus we may see quoth he how the world wags
tis but an hour ago since it was nine
and after one hour more twill be eleven
and so from hour to hour we ripe and ripe
and then from hour to hour we rot and rot
and thereby hangs a tale when i did hear
the motley fool thus moral on the time
my lungs began to crow like chanticleer
that fools should be so deepcontemplative
and i did laugh sans intermission
an hour by his dial o noble fool
a worthy fool motleys the only wear

duke seniorwhat fool is this

jaqueso worthy fool one that hath been a courtier
and says if ladies be but young and fair
they have the gift to know it and in his brain
which is as dry as the remainder biscuit
after a voyage he hath strange places crammd
with observation the which he vents
in mangled forms o that i were a fool
i am ambitious for a motley coat

duke seniorthou shalt have one

jaquesit is my only suit
provided that you weed your better judgments
of all opinion that grows rank in them
that i am wise i must have liberty
withal as large a charter as the wind
to blow on whom i please for so fools have
and they that are most galled with my folly
they most must laugh and why sir must they so
the why is plain as way to parish church
he that a fool doth very wisely hit
doth very foolishly although he smart
not to seem senseless of the bob if not
the wise mans folly is anatomized
even by the squandering glances of the fool
invest me in my motley give me leave
to speak my mind and i will through and through
cleanse the foul body of the infected world
if they will patiently receive my medicine

duke seniorfie on thee i can tell what thou wouldst do

jaqueswhat for a counter would i do but good

duke seniormost mischievous foul sin in chiding sin
for thou thyself hast been a libertine
as sensual as the brutish sting itself
and all the embossed sores and headed evils
that thou with licence of free foot hast caught
wouldst thou disgorge into the general world

jaqueswhy who cries out on pride
that can therein tax any private party
doth it not flow as hugely as the sea
till that the weary very means do ebb
what woman in the city do i name
when that i say the citywoman bears
the cost of princes on unworthy shoulders
who can come in and say that i mean her
when such a one as she such is her neighbour
or what is he of basest function
that says his bravery is not of my cost
thinking that i mean him but therein suits
his folly to the mettle of my speech
there then how then what then let me see wherein
my tongue hath wrongd him if it do him right
then he hath wrongd himself if he be free
why then my taxing like a wildgoose flies
unclaimd of any man but who comes here

enter orlando with his sword drawn

orlandoforbear and eat no more

jaqueswhy i have eat none yet

orlandonor shalt not till necessity be served

or else a rude despiser of good manners
that in civility thou seemst so empty

orlandoyou touchd my vein at first the thorny point
of bare distress hath taen from me the show
of smooth civility yet am i inland bred
and know some nurture but forbear i say
he dies that touches any of this fruit
till i and my affairs are answered

jaquesan you will not be answered with reason i must die

more than your force move us to gentleness

orlandoi almost die for food and let me have it

duke seniorsit down and feed and welcome to our table

orlandospeak you so gently pardon me i pray you
i thought that all things had been savage here
and therefore put i on the countenance
of stern commandment but whateer you are
that in this desert inaccessible
under the shade of melancholy boughs
lose and neglect the creeping hours of time
if ever you have lookd on better days
if ever been where bells have knolld to church
if ever sat at any good mans feast
if ever from your eyelids wiped a tear
and know what tis to pity and be pitied
let gentleness my strong enforcement be
in the which hope i blush and hide my sword

duke seniortrue is it that we have seen better days
and have with holy bell been knolld to church
and sat at good mens feasts and wiped our eyes
of drops that sacred pity hath engenderd
and therefore sit you down in gentleness
and take upon command what help we have
that to your wanting may be ministerd

orlandothen but forbear your food a little while
whiles like a doe i go to find my fawn
and give it food there is an old poor man
who after me hath many a weary step
limpd in pure love till he be first sufficed
oppressd with two weak evils age and hunger
i will not touch a bit

duke seniorthou seest we are not all alone unhappy
this wide and universal theatre
presents more woeful pageants than the scene
wherein we play in

jaquesall the worlds a stage
and all the men and women merely players
they have their exits and their entrances
and one man in his time plays many parts
his acts being seven ages at first the infant
mewling and puking in the nurses arms
and then the whining schoolboy with his satchel
and shining morning face creeping like snail
unwillingly to school and then the lover
sighing like furnace with a woeful ballad
made to his mistress eyebrow then a soldier
full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard
jealous in honour sudden and quick in quarrel
seeking the bubble reputation
even in the cannons mouth and then the justice
in fair round belly with good capon lined
with eyes severe and beard of formal cut
full of wise saws and modern instances
and so he plays his part the sixth age shifts
into the lean and slipperd pantaloon
with spectacles on nose and pouch on side
his youthful hose well saved a world too wide
for his shrunk shank and his big manly voice
turning again toward childish treble pipes
and whistles in his sound last scene of all
that ends this strange eventful history
is second childishness and mere oblivion
sans teeth sans eyes sans taste sans everything

like it very well but in respect that it is
private it is a very vile life now in respect it
is in the fields it pleaseth me well but in

corinhere comes young master ganymede my new mistresss brother

enter rosalind with a paper reading

rosalind     from the east to western ind
no jewel is like rosalind
her worth being mounted on the wind
through all the world bears rosalind
all the pictures fairest lined
are but black to rosalind
let no fair be kept in mind
but the fair of rosalind

touchstoneill rhyme you so eight years together dinners and
suppers and sleepinghours excepted it is the
right butterwomens rank to market

rosalindout fool

touchstonefor a taste
if a hart do lack a hind
let him seek out rosalind
if the cat will after kind
so be sure will rosalind
winter garments must be lined
so must slender rosalind
they that reap must sheaf and bind
then to cart with rosalind
sweetest nut hath sourest rind
such a nut is rosalind
he that sweetest rose will find
must find loves prick and rosalind
this is the very false gallop of verses why do you
infect yourself with them

rosalindpeace you dull fool i found them on a tree

touchstonetruly the tree yields bad fruit

rosalindill graff it with you and then i shall graff it
with a medlar then it will be the earliest fruit
i the country for youll be rotten ere you be half
ripe and thats the right virtue of the medlar

touchstoneyou have said but whether wisely or no let the
forest judge

enter celia with a writing

rosalindpeace here comes my sister reading stand aside

celiareads

why should this a desert be
for it is unpeopled no
tongues ill hang on every tree
that shall civil sayings show
some how brief the life of man
runs his erring pilgrimage
that the stretching of a span
buckles in his sum of age
some of violated vows
twixt the souls of friend and friend
but upon the fairest boughs
or at every sentence end
will i rosalinda write
teaching all that read to know
the quintessence of every sprite
heaven would in little show
therefore heaven nature charged
that one body should be filld
with all graces wideenlarged
nature presently distilld
helens cheek but not her heart
cleopatras majesty
atalantas better part
sad lucretias modesty
thus rosalind of many parts
by heavenly synod was devised
of many faces eyes and hearts
to have the touches dearest prized
heaven would that she these gifts should have
and i to live and die her slave

rosalindo most gentle pulpiter what tedious homily of love
have you wearied your parishioners withal and never
cried have patience good people

celiahow now back friends shepherd go off a little
go with him sirrah

though not with bag and baggage yet with scrip and scrippage

exeunt corin and touchstone

celiadidst thou hear these verses

rosalindo yes i heard them all and more too for some of
them had in them more feet than the verses would bear

celiathats no matter the feet might bear the verses

rosalinday but the feet were lame and could not bear
themselves without the verse and therefore stood
lamely in the verse

celiabut didst thou hear without wondering how thy name
should be hanged and carved upon these trees

rosalindi was seven of the nine days out of the wonder
before you came for look here what i found on a
palmtree i was never so berhymed since
pythagoras time that i was an irish rat which i
can hardly remember

celiatrow you who hath done this

change you colour

rosalindi prithee who

celiao lord lord it is a hard matter for friends to
meet but mountains may be removed with earthquakes
and so encounter

rosalindnay but who is it

celiais it possible

rosalindnay i prithee now with most petitionary vehemence
tell me who it is

celiao wonderful wonderful and most wonderful
wonderful and yet again wonderful and after that
out of all hooping

rosalindgood my complexion dost thou think though i am
caparisoned like a man i have a doublet and hose in
my disposition one inch of delay more is a
southsea of discovery i prithee tell me who is it
quickly and speak apace i would thou couldst
stammer that thou mightst pour this concealed man
out of thy mouth as wine comes out of a narrow
mouthed bottle either too much at once or none at
all i prithee take the cork out of thy mouth that
may drink thy tidings

celiaso you may put a man in your belly

rosalindis he of gods making what manner of man is his
head worth a hat or his chin worth a beard

celianay he hath but a little beard

rosalindwhy god will send more if the man will be
thankful let me stay the growth of his beard if
thou delay me not the knowledge of his chin

celiait is young orlando that tripped up the wrestlers

hose what did he when thou sawest him what said
he how looked he wherein went he what makes
him here did he ask for me where remains he
how parted he with thee and when shalt thou see
him again answer me in one word

celiayou must borrow me gargantuas mouth first tis a
word too great for any mouth of this ages size to
say ay and no to these particulars is more than to
answer in a catechism

rosalindbut doth he know that i am in this forest and in
mans apparel looks he as freshly as he did the
day he wrestled

celiait is as easy to count atomies as to resolve the
propositions of a lover but take a taste of my
finding him and relish it with good observance
i found him under a tree like a dropped acorn

rosalindit may well be called joves tree when it drops
forth such fruit

celiagive me audience good madam

rosalindproceed

celiathere lay he stretched along like a wounded knight

rosalindthough it be pity to see such a sight it well
becomes the ground

celiacry holla to thy tongue i prithee it curvets
unseasonably he was furnished like a hunter

rosalindo ominous he comes to kill my heart

celiai would sing my song without a burden thou bringest
me out of tune

too for your society

jaquesgod be wi you lets meet as little as we can

orlandoi do desire we may be better strangers

jaquesi pray you mar no more trees with writing
lovesongs in their barks

orlandoi pray you mar no more of my verses with reading
them illfavouredly

jaquesrosalind is your loves name

orlandoyes just

jaquesi do not like her name

orlandothere was no thought of pleasing you when she was
christened

jaqueswhat stature is she of

orlandojust as high as my heart

jaquesyou are full of pretty answers have you not been
acquainted with goldsmiths wives and conned them
out of rings

orlandonot so but i answer you right painted cloth from
whence you have studied your questions

jaquesyou have a nimble wit i think twas made of
atalantas heels will you sit down with me and
we two will rail against our mistress the world and
all our misery

orlandoi will chide no breather in the world but myself
against whom i know most faults

jaquesthe worst fault you have is to be in love

orlandotis a fault i will not change for your best virtue
i am weary of you

jaquesby my troth i was seeking for a fool when i found
you

orlandohe is drowned in the brook look but in and you
shall see him

jaquesthere i shall see mine own figure

orlandowhich i take to be either a fool or a cipher

jaquesill tarry no longer with you farewell good
signior love

orlandoi am glad of your departure adieu good monsieur
melancholy

exit jaques

rosalindaside to celia  i will speak to him like a saucy
lackey and under that habit play the knave with him
do you hear forester

orlandovery well what would you

rosalindi pray you what ist oclock

orlandoyou should ask me what time o day theres no clock
in the forest

rosalindthen there is no true lover in the forest else
sighing every minute and groaning every hour would
detect the lazy foot of time as well as a clock

orlandoand why not the swift foot of time had not that
been as proper

rosalindby no means sir time travels in divers paces with
divers persons ill tell you who time ambles
withal who time trots withal who time gallops
withal and who he stands still withal

orlandoi prithee who doth he trot withal

rosalindmarry he trots hard with a young maid between the
contract of her marriage and the day it is
solemnized if the interim be but a sennight
times pace is so hard that it seems the length of
seven year

orlandowho ambles time withal

rosalindwith a priest that lacks latin and a rich man that
hath not the gout for the one sleeps easily because
he cannot study and the other lives merrily because
he feels no pain the one lacking the burden of lean
and wasteful learning the other knowing no burden
of heavy tedious penury these time ambles withal

orlandowho doth he gallop withal

rosalindwith a thief to the gallows for though he go as
softly as foot can fall he thinks himself too soon there

orlandowho stays it still withal

rosalindwith lawyers in the vacation for they sleep between
term and term and then they perceive not how time moves

orlandowhere dwell you pretty youth

rosalindwith this shepherdess my sister here in the
skirts of the forest like fringe upon a petticoat

orlandoare you native of this place

rosalindas the cony that you see dwell where she is kindled

orlandoyour accent is something finer than you could
purchase in so removed a dwelling

rosalindi have been told so of many but indeed an old
religious uncle of mine taught me to speak who was
in his youth an inland man one that knew courtship
too well for there he fell in love i have heard
him read many lectures against it and i thank god
i am not a woman to be touched with so many
giddy offences as he hath generally taxed their
whole sex withal

orlandocan you remember any of the principal evils that he
laid to the charge of women

rosalindthere were none principal they were all like one
another as halfpence are every one fault seeming
monstrous till his fellow fault came to match it

orlandoi prithee recount some of them

rosalindno i will not cast away my physic but on those that
are sick there is a man haunts the forest that
abuses our young plants with carving rosalind on
their barks hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies
on brambles all forsooth deifying the name of
rosalind if i could meet that fancymonger i would
give him some good counsel for he seems to have the
quotidian of love upon him

orlandoi am he that is so loveshaked i pray you tell me
your remedy

rosalindthere is none of my uncles marks upon you he
taught me how to know a man in love in which cage
of rushes i am sure you are not prisoner

orlandowhat were his marks

rosalinda lean cheek which you have not a blue eye and
sunken which you have not an unquestionable
spirit which you have not a beard neglected
which you have not but i pardon you for that for
simply your having in beard is a younger brothers
revenue then your hose should be ungartered your
bonnet unbanded your sleeve unbuttoned your shoe
untied and every thing about you demonstrating a
careless desolation but you are no such man you
are rather pointdevice in your accoutrements as
loving yourself than seeming the lover of any other

orlandofair youth i would i could make thee believe i love

rosalindme believe it you may as soon make her that you
love believe it which i warrant she is apter to
do than to confess she does that is one of the
points in the which women still give the lie to
their consciences but in good sooth are you he
that hangs the verses on the trees wherein rosalind
is so admired

orlandoi swear to thee youth by the white hand of
rosalind i am that he that unfortunate he

rosalindbut are you so much in love as your rhymes speak

orlandoneither rhyme nor reason can express how much

rosalindlove is merely a madness and i tell you deserves
as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do and
the reason why they are not so punished and cured
is that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers
are in love too yet i profess curing it by counsel

orlandodid you ever cure any so

rosalindyes one and in this manner he was to imagine me
his love his mistress and i set him every day to
woo me at which time would i being but a moonish
youth grieve be effeminate changeable longing
and liking proud fantastical apish shallow
inconstant full of tears full of smiles for every
passion something and for no passion truly any
thing as boys and women are for the most part
cattle of this colour would now like him now loathe
him then entertain him then forswear him now weep
for him then spit at him that i drave my suitor
from his mad humour of love to a living humour of
madness which was to forswear the full stream of
the world and to live in a nook merely monastic
and thus i cured him and this way will i take upon
me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheeps
heart that there shall not be one spot of love int

orlandoi would not be cured youth

rosalindi would cure you if you would but call me rosalind
and come every day to my cote and woo me

orlandonow by the faith of my love i will tell me
where it is

rosalindgo with me to it and ill show it you and by the way
you shall tell me where in the forest you live
will you go

orlandowith all my heart good youth

touchstonei am here with thee and thy goats as the most
capricious poet honest ovid was among the goths

jaquesaside  o knowledge illinhabited worse than jove
in a thatched house

touchstonewhen a mans verses cannot be understood nor a
mans good wit seconded with the forward child
understanding it strikes a man more dead than a
great reckoning in a little room truly i would
the gods had made thee poetical

audreyi do not know what poetical is is it honest in
deed and word is it a true thing

touchstoneno truly for the truest poetry is the most
feigning and lovers are given to poetry and what
they swear in poetry may be said as lovers they do feign

audreydo you wish then that the gods had made me poetical

touchstonei do truly for thou swearest to me thou art
honest now if thou wert a poet i might have some
hope thou didst feign

audreywould you not have me honest

touchstoneno truly unless thou wert hardfavoured for
honesty coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugar

jaquesaside  a material fool

audrey well i am not fair and therefore i pray the gods
make me honest

touchstonetruly and to cast away honesty upon a foul slut
were to put good meat into an unclean dish

audreyi am not a slut though i thank the gods i am foul

touchstonewell praised be the gods for thy foulness
sluttishness may come hereafter but be it as it may
be i will marry thee and to that end i have been
with sir oliver martext the vicar of the next
village who hath promised to meet me in this place
of the forest and to couple us

jaquesaside  i would fain see this meeting

audreywell the gods give us joy

touchstoneamen a man may if he were of a fearful heart
stagger in this attempt for here we have no temple

though courage as horns are odious they are
necessary it is said many a man knows no end of
his goods right many a man has good horns and
knows no end of them well that is the dowry of
his wife tis none of his own getting horns
even so poor men alone no no the noblest deer
hath them as huge as the rascal is the single man
therefore blessed no as a walled town is more
worthier than a village so is the forehead of a
married man more honourable than the bare brow of a
bachelor and by how much defence is better than no
skill by so much is a horn more precious than to
want here comes sir oliver

church and have a good priest that can tell you
what marriage is this fellow will but join you

prove a shrunk panel and like green timber warp warp

touchstoneaside  i am not in the mind but i were better to be
married of him than of another for he is not like
to marry me well and not being well married it
will be a good excuse for me hereafter to leave my wife

the very ice of chastity is in them

rosalindbut why did he swear he would come this morning and
comes not

celianay certainly there is no truth in him

rosalinddo you think so

celiayes i think he is not a pickpurse nor a
horsestealer but for his verity in love i do
think him as concave as a covered goblet or a
wormeaten nut

rosalindnot true in love

celiayes when he is in but i think he is not in

rosalindyou have heard him swear downright he was

celiawas is not is besides the oath of a lover is
no stronger than the word of a tapster they are
both the confirmer of false reckonings he attends
here in the forest on the duke your father

rosalindi met the duke yesterday and had much question with
him he asked me of what parentage i was i told
him of as good as he so he laughed and let me go

man as orlando

celiao thats a brave man he writes brave verses
speaks brave words swears brave oaths and breaks

phebei would not be thy executioner
i fly thee for i would not injure thee
thou tellst me there is murder in mine eye
tis pretty sure and very probable
that eyes that are the frailst and softest things
who shut their coward gates on atomies
should be calld tyrants butchers murderers
now i do frown on thee with all my heart
and if mine eyes can wound now let them kill thee
now counterfeit to swoon why now fall down
or if thou canst not o for shame for shame
lie not to say mine eyes are murderers
now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee
scratch thee but with a pin and there remains
some scar of it lean but upon a rush
the cicatrice and capable impressure
thy palm some moment keeps but now mine eyes
which i have darted at thee hurt thee not
nor i am sure there is no force in eyes
that can do hurt

that you insult exult and all at once
over the wretched what though you have no beauty
as by my faith i see no more in you

must you be therefore proud and pitiless
why what means this why do you look on me
i see no more in you than in the ordinary
of natures salework ods my little life
i think she means to tangle my eyes too
no faith proud mistress hope not after it
tis not your inky brows your black silk hair
your bugle eyeballs nor your cheek of cream
that can entame my spirits to your worship
you foolish shepherd wherefore do you follow her
like foggy south puffing with wind and rain
you are a thousand times a properer man
than she a woman tis such fools as you
that makes the world full of illfavourd children
tis not her glass but you that flatters her
and out of you she sees herself more proper
than any of her lineaments can show her
but mistress know yourself down on your knees
and thank heaven fasting for a good mans love
for i must tell you friendly in your ear
sell when you can you are not for all markets
cry the man mercy love him take his offer
foul is most foul being foul to be a scoffer
so take her to thee shepherd fare you well

silviusso holy and so perfect is my love
and i in such a poverty of grace
that i shall think it a most plenteous crop
to glean the broken ears after the man
that the main harvest reaps loose now and then
a scatterd smile and that ill live upon

phebeknowst now the youth that spoke to me erewhile

silviusnot very well but i have met him oft
and he hath bought the cottage and the bounds
that the old carlot once was master of

phebethink not i love him though i ask for him
tis but a peevish boy yet he talks well
but what care i for words yet words do well
when he that speaks them pleases those that hear
it is a pretty youth not very pretty
but sure hes proud and yet his pride becomes him
hell make a proper man the best thing in him
is his complexion and faster than his tongue
did make offence his eye did heal it up
he is not very tall yet for his years hes tall
his leg is but so so and yet tis well
there was a pretty redness in his lip
a little riper and more lusty red
than that mixd in his cheek twas just the difference
between the constant red and mingled damask
there be some women silvius had they markd him
in parcels as i did would have gone near
to fall in love with him but for my part
i love him not nor hate him not and yet
i have more cause to hate him than to love him
for what had he to do to chide at me
he said mine eyes were black and my hair black
and now i am rememberd scornd at me
i marvel why i answerd not again
but thats all one omittance is no quittance
ill write to him a very taunting letter
and thou shalt bear it wilt thou silvius

silviusphebe with all my heart

phebeill write it straight
the matters in my head and in my heart
i will be bitter with him and passing short
go with me silvius

jaquesi prithee pretty youth let me be better acquainted
with thee

rosalindthey say you are a melancholy fellow

jaquesi am so i do love it better than laughing

rosalindthose that are in extremity of either are abominable
fellows and betray themselves to every modern
censure worse than drunkards

jaqueswhy tis good to be sad and say nothing

rosalindwhy then tis good to be a post

jaquesi have neither the scholars melancholy which is
emulation nor the musicians which is fantastical
nor the courtiers which is proud nor the
soldiers which is ambitious nor the lawyers
which is politic nor the ladys which is nice nor
the lovers which is all these but it is a
melancholy of mine own compounded of many simples
extracted from many objects and indeed the sundrys
contemplation of my travels in which my often
rumination wraps me m a most humorous sadness

rosalinda traveller by my faith you have great reason to
be sad i fear you have sold your own lands to see
other mens then to have seen much and to have
nothing is to have rich eyes and poor hands

jaquesyes i have gained my experience

rosalindand your experience makes you sad i had rather have
a fool to make me merry than experience to make me
sad and to travel for it too

enter orlando

orlandogood day and happiness dear rosalind

jaquesnay then god be wi you an you talk in blank verse

exit

rosalindfarewell monsieur traveller look you lisp and

own country be out of love with your nativity and
almost chide god for making you that countenance you

gondola why how now orlando where have you been
all this while you a lover an you serve me such
another trick never come in my sight more

orlandomy fair rosalind i come within an hour of my promise

rosalindbreak an hours promise in love he that will
divide a minute into a thousand parts and break but
a part of the thousandth part of a minute in the
affairs of love it may be said of him that cupid
hath clapped him o the shoulder but ill warrant

orlandopardon me dear rosalind

rosalindnay an you be so tardy come no more in my sight i
had as lief be wooed of a snail

orlandoof a snail

rosalinday of a snail for though he comes slowly he
carries his house on his head a better jointure
i think than you make a woman besides he brings
his destiny with him

orlandowhats that

rosalindwhy horns which such as you are fain to be
beholding to your wives for but he comes armed in
his fortune and prevents the slander of his wife

orlandovirtue is no hornmaker and my rosalind is virtuous

rosalindand i am your rosalind

celiait pleases him to call you so but he hath a
rosalind of a better leer than you

rosalindcome woo me woo me for now i am in a holiday
humour and like enough to consent what would you
say to me now an i were your very very rosalind

orlandoi would kiss before i spoke

rosalindnay you were better speak first and when you were
gravelled for lack of matter you might take
occasion to kiss very good orators when they are
out they will spit and for lovers lackinggod
warn usmatter the cleanliest shift is to kiss

orlandohow if the kiss be denied

rosalindthen she puts you to entreaty and there begins new matter

orlandowho could be out being before his beloved mistress

rosalindmarry that should you if i were your mistress or
i should think my honesty ranker than my wit

orlandowhat of my suit

orlandoi take some joy to say you are because i would be
talking of her

rosalindwell in her person i say i will not have you

orlandothen in mine own person i die

rosalindno faith die by attorney the poor world is
almost six thousand years old and in all this time
there was not any man died in his own person
videlicit in a lovecause troilus had his brains
dashed out with a grecian club yet he did what he
could to die before and he is one of the patterns
of love leander he would have lived many a fair
year though hero had turned nun if it had not been
for a hot midsummer night for good youth he went
but forth to wash him in the hellespont and being
taken with the cramp was drowned and the foolish
coroners of that age found it was hero of sestos
but these are all lies men have died from time to
time and worms have eaten them but not for love

orlandoi would not have my right rosalind of this mind
for i protest her frown might kill me

rosalindby this hand it will not kill a fly but come now
i will be your rosalind in a more comingon
disposition and ask me what you will i will grant

orlandoi take thee rosalind for wife

rosalindi might ask you for your commission but i do take

orlandofor ever and a day

rosalindsay a day without the ever no no orlando
men are april when they woo december when they wed
maids are may when they are maids but the sky
changes when they are wives i will be more jealous
of thee than a barbary cockpigeon over his hen
more clamorous than a parrot against rain more
newfangled than an ape more giddy in my desires
than a monkey i will weep for nothing like diana
in the fountain and i will do that when you are
disposed to be merry i will laugh like a hyen and
that when thou art inclined to sleep

orlandobut will my rosalind do so

rosalindby my life she will do as i do

orlandoo but she is wise

rosalindor else she could not have the wit to do this the
wiser the waywarder make the doors upon a womans
wit and it will out at the casement shut that and
twill out at the keyhole stop that twill fly
with the smoke out at the chimney

orlandoa man that had a wife with such a wit he might say
wit whither wilt

rosalindnay you might keep that cheque for it till you met
your wifes wit going to your neighbours bed

orlandoand what wit could wit have to excuse that

rosalindmarry to say she came to seek you there you shall
never take her without her answer unless you take
her without her tongue o that woman that cannot
make her fault her husbands occasion let her
never nurse her child herself for she will breed
it like a fool

orlandofor these two hours rosalind i will leave thee

rosalindalas dear love i cannot lack thee two hours

orlandoi must attend the duke at dinner by two oclock i
will be with thee again

orlandoay sweet rosalind

rosalindby my troth and in good earnest and so god mend
me and by all pretty oaths that are not dangerous
if you break one jot of your promise or come one
minute behind your hour i will think you the most
pathetical breakpromise and the most hollow lover
and the most unworthy of her you call rosalind that
may be chosen out of the gross band of the
unfaithful therefore beware my censure and keep
your promise

silviusmy errand is to you fair youth
my gentle phebe bid me give you this
i know not the contents but as i guess
by the stern brow and waspish action
which she did use as she was writing of it
it bears an angry tenor pardon me
i am but as a guiltless messenger

rosalindpatience herself would startle at this letter
and play the swaggerer bear this bear all
she says i am not fair that i lack manners
she calls me proud and that she could not love me
were man as rare as phoenix ods my will
her love is not the hare that i do hunt
why writes she so to me well shepherd well
this is a letter of your own device

silviusno i protest i know not the contents
phebe did write it

rosalindcome come you are a fool
and turnd into the extremity of love
i saw her hand she has a leathern hand
a freestonecolourd hand i verily did think
that her old gloves were on but twas her hands
she has a huswifes hand but thats no matter
i say she never did invent this letter
this is a mans invention and his hand

silviussure it is hers

rosalindwhy tis a boisterous and a cruel style
a style forchallengers why she defies me
like turk to christian womens gentle brain
could not drop forth such giantrude invention
such ethiope words blacker in their effect
than in their countenance will you hear the letter

silviusso please you for i never heard it yet
yet heard too much of phebes cruelty

rosalindshe phebes me mark how the tyrant writes

reads

art thou god to shepherd turnd
that a maidens heart hath burnd
can a woman rail thus

silviuscall you this railing

rosalindreads

why thy godhead laid apart
warrst thou with a womans heart
did you ever hear such railing
whiles the eye of man did woo me
that could do no vengeance to me
meaning me a beast
if the scorn of your bright eyne
have power to raise such love in mine
alack in me what strange effect
would they work in mild aspect
whiles you chid me i did love
how then might your prayers move
he that brings this love to thee
little knows this love in me
and by him seal up thy mind
whether that thy youth and kind
will the faithful offer take
of me and all that i can make
or else by him my love deny
and then ill study how to die

silviuscall you this chiding

celiaalas poor shepherd

rosalinddo you pity him no he deserves no pity wilt
thou love such a woman what to make thee an
instrument and play false strains upon thee not to
be endured well go your way to her for i see
love hath made thee a tame snake and say this to
her that if she love me i charge her to love
thee if she will not i will never have her unless
thou entreat for her if you be a true lover
hence and not a word for here comes more company

left on your right hand brings you to the place
but at this hour the house doth keep itself
theres none within

oliversome of my shame if you will know of me
what man i am and how and why and where
this handkercher was staind

celiai pray you tell it

oliverwhen last the young orlando parted from you
he left a promise to return again
within an hour and pacing through the forest
chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy
lo what befell he threw his eye aside
and mark what object did present itself
under an oak whose boughs were mossd with age
and high top bald with dry antiquity
a wretched ragged man oergrown with hair
lay sleeping on his back about his neck
a green and gilded snake had wreathed itself
who with her head nimble in threats approachd
the opening of his mouth but suddenly
seeing orlando it unlinkd itself
and with indented glides did slip away
into a bush under which bushs shade
a lioness with udders all drawn dry
lay couching head on ground with catlike watch
when that the sleeping man should stir for tis
the royal disposition of that beast
to prey on nothing that doth seem as dead
this seen orlando did approach the man
and found it was his brother his elder brother

celiao i have heard him speak of that same brother
and he did render him the most unnatural
that lived amongst men

oliverand well he might so do
for well i know he was unnatural

rosalindbut to orlando did he leave him there
food to the suckd and hungry lioness

olivertwice did he turn his back and purposed so
but kindness nobler ever than revenge
and nature stronger than his just occasion
made him give battle to the lioness
who quickly fell before him in which hurtling
from miserable slumber i awaked

celiaare you his brother

rosalindwast you he rescued

celiawast you that did so oft contrive to kill him

olivertwas i but tis not ii do not shame
to tell you what i was since my conversion
so sweetly tastes being the thing i am

rosalindbut for the bloody napkin

oliverby and by
when from the first to last betwixt us two
tears our recountments had most kindly bathed
as how i came into that desert place
in brief he led me to the gentle duke
who gave me fresh array and entertainment
committing me unto my brothers love
who led me instantly unto his cave
there strippd himself and here upon his arm
the lioness had torn some flesh away
which all this while had bled and now he fainted
and cried in fainting upon rosalind
brief i recoverd him bound up his wound
and after some small space being strong at heart
he sent me hither stranger as i am
to tell this story that you might excuse
his broken promise and to give this napkin
dyed in his blood unto the shepherd youth
that he in sport doth call his rosalind

rosalind swoons

quarrel on the seventh cause

touchstoneupon a lie seven times removedbear your body more
seeming audreyas thus sir i did dislike the
cut of a certain courtiers beard he sent me word
if i said his beard was not cut well he was in the
mind it was this is called the retort courteous
if i sent him word again it was not well cut he
would send me word he cut it to please himself
this is called the quip modest if again it was
not well cut he disabled my judgment this is
called the reply churlish if again it was not
well cut he would answer i spake not true this
is called the reproof valiant if again it was not
well cut he would say i lied this is called the
countercheque quarrelsome and so to the lie
circumstantial and the lie direct

jaquesand how oft did you say his beard was not well cut

touchstonei durst go no further than the lie circumstantial
nor he durst not give me the lie direct and so we
measured swords and parted

jaquescan you nominate in order now the degrees of the lie

touchstoneo sir we quarrel in print by the book as you have
books for good manners i will name you the degrees
the first the retort courteous the second the
quip modest the third the reply churlish the
fourth the reproof valiant the fifth the
countercheque quarrelsome the sixth the lie with
circumstance the seventh the lie direct all
these you may avoid but the lie direct and you may
avoid that too with an if i knew when seven
justices could not take up a quarrel but when the
parties were met themselves one of them thought but
of an if as if you said so then i said so and
they shook hands and swore brothers your if is the
only peacemaker much virtue in if

enter jaques de boys

jaques de boyslet me have audience for a word or two
i am the second son of old sir rowland
that bring these tidings to this fair assembly
duke frederick hearing how that every day
men of great worth resorted to this forest
addressd a mighty power which were on foot
in his own conduct purposely to take
his brother here and put him to the sword
and to the skirts of this wild wood he came
where meeting with an old religious man
after some question with him was converted
both from his enterprise and from the world
his crown bequeathing to his banishd brother
and all their lands restored to them again
that were with him exiled this to be true
i do engage my life

duke seniorwelcome young man
thou offerst fairly to thy brothers wedding
to one his lands withheld and to the other
a land itself at large a potent dukedom
first in this forest let us do those ends
that here were well begun and well begot
and after every of this happy number
that have endured shrewd days and nights with us
shall share the good of our returned fortune
according to the measure of their states
meantime forget this newfalln dignity
and fall into our rustic revelry
play music and you brides and bridegrooms all
with measure heapd in joy to the measures fall

jaquessir by your patience if i heard you rightly
the duke hath put on a religious life
and thrown into neglect the pompous court

jaques de boyshe hath

jaquesto him will i  out of these convertites
there is much matter to be heard and learnd

to duke senior

you to your former honour i bequeath
your patience and your virtue well deserves it

to orlando

you to a love that your true faith doth merit

to oliver

you to your land and love and great allies

to silvius

you to a long and welldeserved bed

as we do trust theyll end in true delights

a dance




as you like it

epilogue


rosalindit is not the fashion to see the lady the epilogue
but it is no more unhandsome than to see the lord
the prologue if it be true that good wine needs
no bush tis true that a good play needs no
epilogue yet to good wine they do use good bushes
and good plays prove the better by the help of good
epilogues what a case am i in then that am
neither a good epilogue nor cannot insinuate with
you in the behalf of a good play i am not
furnished like a beggar therefore to beg will not
become me my way is to conjure you and ill begin
with the women i charge you o women for the love
you bear to men to like as much of this play as
please you and i charge you o men for the love
you bear to womenas i perceive by your simpering
none of you hates themthat between you and the
women the play may please if i were a woman i
would kiss as many of you as had beards that pleased
me complexions that liked me and breaths that i
defied not and i am sure as many as have good
beards or good faces or sweet breaths will for my
kind offer when i make curtsy bid me farewell
